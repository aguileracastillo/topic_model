Analysing Efforts to Co-create an Improved Social Welfare System through Taking Advantage of a Collaborative Economy",NA,"10.24251/HICSS.2019.358","Welfare sectors across the world are facing the need to balance the contrast between economic pressures due to demographic changes and peoples’ rising expectations of receiving services that are transparent; timely and tailored to citizens’ habits and needs. This means that governments are pressured to look for new ways to deliver public services. This article looks at two co-created peer-to-peer platforms that are engaged in delivering public services in the welfare sector, Helpific and Caremate, and their development and role in the Estonian welfare sector. These platforms appear to hold substantial potential for changing the current system of delivering public services, however they have not yet managed to acquire the anticipated level of success. By examining these two cases, it is proposed that the room and support for developing new solutions, using experience in the field and overcoming the digital divide must be assured in order to make changes in government welfare possible."

This has been enabled by the tremendous standardization effort to describe, advertise, discover, and invoke Web services. Digital government (DG) is a major application domain for Web services. It aims at improving government-citizen interactions using information and communication technologies. Government agencies collect, store, process, and share information about millions of citizens who have different preferences regarding their privacy. This naturally raises a number of legal and technical issues that must be addressed to preserve citizens' privacy through the control of the information flow amongst different entities (users, Web services, DBMSs). Solutions addressing this issue are still in their infancy. They consist, essentially, of enforcing privacy by law or by self-regulation. In this paper, we propose a new technical approach for preserving privacy in government Web services. Our design is based on digital privacy credentials, data filters and mobile privacy preserving agents. This work aims at establishing the feasibility and provable reliability of technology-based privacy preserving solutions for Web service infrastructures."

One of the most important challenges for e-Government services is matching particular needs and interests of citizens and businesses to achieve efficient e-Government services quality. Recommender systems have been proposed to deliver users with the most interesting information service thereby addressing the information overload problem. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of a recommender system in an e-Government context to provide personalized G2C e-services. The proposed approach combines the expert pre-defined categorization of the e-government services and the citizens rating history to identify the relevant services for the active citizen. The efficiency of the proposed e-Government services personalization method is studied via a comparative study with the benchmark item-based and a state-of-the-art recommender system for Government-to-Business e-services. Experimental results show a considerable improvement for the proposed recommendation approach in term of performance and accuracy."

Past studies also suggest that e-voting is embedded in the socio-politically context informing variations in the adoption patterns and nature of challenges faced during implementation. While few survey-based empirical studies have been carried out to better understand factors affecting successful adoption of e-voting, there is general paucity of ethnographic studies and analysis providing detailed insights to e-voting adoption in specific contexts. This study offers such ethnography through in-depth analysis of e-voting adoption in the 2011 Nigerian General Elections. Using a multi-level Innovation Adoption Framework as a theoretical lens, we analyze the observations made by one of the authors as a participant in the adoption and implementation of the e-voting initiative as well as the post-election reports. Results from analysis revealed core factors for the different levels of e-voting adoption constructs - socio-political context, organizations, innovation and individual. Results also identified factors and challenges that may negatively impact e-voting adoption."

The lack of a clear and widely usable definition and such as delimitation areas and indicators makes it difficult to compare or measure cities in this context. This paper compares some of the Brazilian capital indicators and presents a maturity model called br-SCMM (Brazilian Smart City Maturity Model) developed to allow extracted indicators of public databases may be used to assist city managers."

Effective response planning requires inter-operability among systems belonging to different organizations. Unlike typical e-government processes that are well structured and have a well-defined outcome, emergency response processes are knowledge centric and their workflow structure and execution may evolve dynamically based on the environmental context as well as the type of service/activity invoked during process execution. It is impractical to define static plans and response process workflow for every possible situation due to the fact that unforeseeable situations may arise. Thus, a dynamic response requires adaptability to changing situation as the incident evolves. This article presents an approach for development of an Emergency Response Plan Recommendation and Composition System (ERPRCS) that, as the incident evolves, facilitates dynamic composition of an executable response plan by exploiting the knowledge of existing plans and learning from them. Specifically, the ERPRCS system generates an executable response plan from an existing response process that was instantiated for an incident most similar to the current incident. This response plan is customized based on available services and resource provider systems in a given jurisdiction and geographical area."

However, the success of eGovernment is best measured by the perceptions of citizens who use the services. This paper, the second of a two-part study seeks to investigate the types of public value that are desired as outcomes of eGovernment as well as the salient factors that are significant in predicting value creation from the perspective of citizens. To fulfil its objectives, the study adopts a theoretical model that integrates two streams of research: (i) the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success Model and (ii) Public Value. Using survey data collected from Nigeria, the model is empirically tested and validated through structural equation modelling analysis. Findings identify democracy, reflexivity and productivity in order of importance, as the three distinct value types desired as outcomes by citizens. Furthermore, results show service quality as the most salient factor significant in predicting citizen satisfaction and citizen trust in eGovernment, while both service quality and citizen satisfaction are significant in predicting net benefits. This research has both theoretical and practical implications. First, it contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the public value creation of eGovernment. Second, it provides a practical reference point for improving service delivery in the public sector."

This paper seeks to investigate the salient factors that are significant in predicting the public value creation of eGovernment from the citizen perspective. To fulfil the purpose of this research, a theoretical model based on the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success Model and the public value approach is adopted. Through data collected from Korea, the model is empirically tested and validated using structural equation modeling technique. Findings reveal that information quality and system quality significantly predict trust in eGovernment, while for citizen satisfaction, information quality and service quality are critical. Information quality, service quality and citizen satisfaction are significant in predicting net benefits. Furthermore, while trust in eGovernment has no mediating effect on the model, citizen satisfaction mediates the relationship between the quality constructs and net benefits. This research has both theoretical and practical implications."

In this context the DALOS project aims at ensuring coherence and alignment in the legislative language, providing law-makers with knowledge management tools to improve the control over the multilingual complexity of European legislation and over the linguistic and conceptual issues involved in its transposition into national laws. This paper describes the design and implementation activities performed on the basis of a set of parallel texts in different languages on a specific legal topic. Natural language processing techniques have been applied to automatically build lexicons for each language. Lexical and conceptual multilingual alignment has been accomplished exploiting terms position in parallel documents. An ontology describing entities involved in the chosen domain has been developed in order to provide a semantic description of terms in lexicons. A modular integration of such resources, represented in RDF/OWL standard format, allowed their effective and flexible access from a legislative drafting application prototype, able to enrich legal documents with terms mark-up and semantic annotations."

However, scholarly efforts providing elaborations, rigorous analysis and comparison of open data models are very limited. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on open data business models are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of open data business models which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. We address this problem by 1) consolidating reported open data business models in both academic and practice literature, 2) describe the models based on a business model framework, and 3) determine open data business models patterns. In addition, we identified the emerging core value disciplines for open data businesses. Our results help to streamline existing useful models, and link them to the overall business strategy through value disciplines."

Therefore, decisions by government to directly support entrepreneurs with Electronic Government (e-Gov) services can have significant impact on economic development. Given the current downward trend in new entrepreneur numbers in many countries, e-Gov services may arguably be best targeted at promotion and lowering of barriers in establishing new businesses. However, delivering effective e-Gov services to entrepreneurs in starting new businesses will require concrete knowledge of entrepreneurial needs on one hand and the barriers to entry and challenges on the other hand. Unfortunately, research dedicated to the real needs of entrepreneurs with respect to e-Gov services is limited. This work fills this knowledge gap through a study of the e-Gov related factors that could contribute to lowering the barriers to entry for new entrepreneurs. Based on the analysis of the information gathered from a series of structured and semi-structured interviews involving 36 fresh entrepreneurs in Finland, we identified four factors related to e-Gov services which could lower the barrier to entrepreneurship."

The benefits of utilizing serious games in education and training and their positive impacts in the field are expected to be the same in an e-government context, hence, it is argued that the use of serious games to expand knowledge, training, build confidence and trust among citizens can improve their use of e-government service. This research paper discusses a study conducted with the aim of developing a “e-Reservation” service as a serious game that expands knowledge and trains Libyan citizens on how to act when using the actual e-service. The proposed serious game is dedicated to familiarizing players with all rules and system requirements. Results show that the use of serious games has a positive impact on citizens' motivation to engage with e-government."

A legal framework is a necessary component of each e-government ecosystem to ensure proper delivery of e-services. This research proposes a legal framework for e-government in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). The research started with the KRI‚Äôs e-Court system project as the first pilot project towards the systematic introduction of e-government in general. The research is based on a qualitative comparative case study of the KRI and Estonia, which is known to have a particularly mature set of e-government regulations. Data have been collected from legal databases, existing literature, and other available legal documentations from both countries. This study aims to provide a foundation for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to conclude plans for digital expansion and implementation of e-government in the KRI. Beyond that, the authors hope that this study extends the existing body of knowledge and literature in a way that is useful for e-government practitioners in other projects and researchers alike."

That is because of a conflict between the logic of the crowds and the logic of policymaking. The crowd's logic differs from that of traditional policymaking in several aspects. To mention some of those: In traditional policymaking it is a small group of experts making proposals to the policy, whereas in crowdsourced policymaking, it is a large, anonymous crowd with a mixed level of expertise. The crowd proposes atomic ideas, whereas traditional policymaking is used to dealing with holistic and synthesized proposals. By drawing on data from a crowdsourced law-making process in Finland, the paper shows how the logics of the crowds and policymaking collide in practice. The conflict prevents policymaking fully benefiting from the crowd's input, and it also hinders governments from adopting crowdsourcing more widely as a practice for deploying open government principles."

The overall state is measured with the Open Data Barometer. Furthermore, we analyse the distribution of file formats, dataset licenses and dataset categories of published open data in NRW. Since the Open Government Pact in NRW was established, the interest in open data and its platforms is increasing. In the last years many new platforms were subsequently deployed. Two most commonly used underlying platforms for publishing open data are DKAN and CKAN. Our goal is to elaborate usability concerns of CKAN and DKAN and formulate recommendations to improve their usability. We conduct a usability study with new users to measure the usability of the platforms and carry out an expert survey with open data maintainers to identify room for improvement. Our research provides evidence that NRW is on par with Germany in the implementation and distribution of open data and that a common open data strategy on a regional level is missing. It also points out that CKAN provides a superior user experience for new users and experienced maintainers compared to DKAN. We further determine critical usability concerns and provide recommendations to improve the usability of CKAN and DKAN."

However, Gov 2.0 fails to attract a satisfying level of citizen participation and has not lived up to expectations. Therefore, governments need to rethink how to engage the digital population via Gov 2.0 to achieve public value. To engage effectively, there needs to be a synergy between citizens and governments. The proposed research model in this paper aims to explain the synergy between citizens and governments that is needed to create public value via Gov 2.0. This synergistic interaction has emergent properties to create substantial public value, which is expected to result in many benefits including the increase in citizen participation via Gov 2. The theoretical foundation of the proposed research model builds on theories such as co-creation and public value. The paper concludes by suggesting further empirical research to evaluate and refine the research model."

We do so based on data obtained from a desktop research and from a worldwide questionnaire directed to the 193 countries that are part of the list used by the Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). The study analyses 12 EGOV assessment initiatives: a) seven of them are international/regional EGOV assessment initiatives performed by the United Nations (UN), European Union (EU), Waseda-IAC, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank (WB), WWW Foundation, and Open Knowledge Network (OKN); b) five of them are country-level EGOV assessment initiatives performed by Norway, Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Further, the study provides general results obtained from a questionnaire with participation from 18 countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ghana, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Portugal, and Slovenia. The findings show that there is no shortage of interest in assessing EGOV initiatives. However, the supply side of EGOV initiatives is the dominant perspective being assessed, particularly by regional and international organizations. While there is an increasing interest in assessing the users' perspective (demand side) by individual countries, such attempts still seem to be at an early stage. Additionally, the actual use and impact of various EGOV services and activities are rarely well identified and measured. This study represents a stepping stone for developing instruments for assessing EGOV initiatives in future works. For the current stage, the study presents several general suggestions to be considered during the assessment process."

Recent economic literature, however, suggests that open competition can perform poorly in allocating complex projects. In exploring the determinants of bidding behavior in tenders for complex IT services, we find results that appear consistent with theory. Our analysis shows that price and quality are linked in a puzzling way: high quality is associated with low prices. We also find that quality proposals are mainly explained by suppliers’ experience. Results suggest that scoring rules at the basis of the tendering process might fail to appropriately incorporate buyers’ complex price/quality preferences."

Such e-services provide governmental agencies with the opportunity to enhance their reputation and increase citizens' engagement with them. However, accomplishing this transformation will not be achieved without removing any impediments that affect citizens' trust in the provided e-services. This paper aims to understand the way social individual differences (age, gender, education level, and Internet experience) affect citizens' trust in e-Government services in developing countries. A survey, looking at people's perception of trust in e-Government, of citizens drawn from different geographical areas in Saudi Arabia, was conducted. The findings of this research indicate that out of the four factors investigated, only education level has a significant impact on citizen's trust in e-government services. Therefore, it appears that as educational level increases, so does citizen's trust in e-government and so they are more likely to engage with these e-government services."

When practitioners embark on legacy systems replacement projects, they tend to use the legacy software's features as business requirements for its replacement application. This unnecessarily reproduces the business processes that have often emerged from the very technical limitations of the legacy system that is being phased out -- a phenomenon referred to as the ""legacy problem."" Public agencies are missing opportunities for innovation when they carry out legacy replacement projects in this conservative manner. Overcoming the legacy problem is ""wickedly"" difficult because of the complex interrelationships of information technology, organizational culture, and government agencies' normative environments. This paper reports on the use of an online survey and qualitative interviews with practitioners in government agencies to explore the legacy problem. The data revealed that public agencies tend to regard legacy system replacement projects as a distinctly technical issue, and that they do not engage in systematic practices to ensure that unnecessary carryover of the business model embedded in legacy technology does not take place. As a result, legacy feature carryover occurs frequently, because practitioners want to minimize business process changes during new system implementation. The study findings single out the procurement of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software as the most common approach to the replacement of legacy systems. When COTS packages are implemented, vendors (technology providers) shape the requirements discussion and the business analysis surrounding feature selection and customization. These study findings can be instrumental when devising solutions to assist agencies in dealing with the legacy problem."

It is also very difficult for the municipal authorities to identify, evaluate and implement the proper developments in a world characterised by the multiplicity of available solutions. Consequently, the policy aspect of a smart city is a major challenge in order to create a collaborative approach to innovation ecosystems based on sustainable partnerships among the main stakeholders from business, research, policy and citizen groups and achieve an alignment of local, regional and European policy levels and resources. The objective of this inquiry is to develop an analysis framework to better understand smart city practices in Greece and to identify the barriers where adaptation and improvement may be needed. Furthermore, this study aims at examining the Greek Municipalities in order to identify homogeneous and heterogeneous characteristics in the process of planning and developing a smart city. The study identifies the most important impediments towards smart cities actions development and the correlation between the smart cities population and the number of implemented actions. The results highlight the deviation of implemented and planned smart cities actions based on the proposed taxonomy identifying the most important development areas for Greece."

However, there has been limited attempt of integrating them. Using a design science approach a second generation of open government data (OGD) platforms has been developed, which offer to the users both the ‘classical’ first generation functionalities, and also a comprehensive set of additional novel Web 2.0 features. The latter aim to provide support to the users in order to generate value from ODG. They enable users to become ‘prosumers’, both producing and consuming data.

The current implementation of SAKASP is clumsy because it is a mixture of online submission and manual collection and verification of information; its time-consuming and tedious procedures are inconvenient for the applicants and inefficient for the administrators. The proposed framework provides an integrated service by employing semantic web service (SWS) and ontology, improving the current implementation of SAKASP by automatically collecting and processing the related information for a given application. The article includes a typical scenario that demonstrates the workflow of the framework. This framework is applicable to other multi-domain e-government services."

In order to investigate the key factors that affect an individual’s use of Information and Communication Technology within the context of electronic government, a framework combining Social Cognitive Theory and Expectation-Confirmation Theory is used to investigate satisfaction and continuity of use of e-government services. Further, the study incorporates DeLone and McLean’s IS success model along with the E-S-QUAL model to incorporate technical, organizational and Information Systems quality into this framework. The proposed framework will help in shaping further studies in cognitive, managerial and technical factors related to e-government adoption and use. This study argues that quality and consistency in e-government services affect the expectations and satisfaction of citizens, therefore impacting on its continuity of use."

This study aims to provide a better understanding to citizens’ adoption of e-government services through conceptualizing the role of intermediary organisations within e-government. In particular, this paper examines the importance of intermediaries in the adoption of e-government from a citizens’ perspective and the potential influence they have on bridging digital divide in societies. Following previous studies on e-government adoption, the study employs the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to examine the influence of intermediaries on citizens’ adoption of e-government services in the context of Madinah city in Saudi Arabia. The results in this study indicates that the citizens’ efforts towards using e-government services, their trust of the Internet and their trust of intermediary organisations contribute significantly towards their e-government adoption behaviour. Further, the facilitating conditions the intermediary organisations offer have a significant impact on the usage of e-government services."

In this study, we take into consideration the engagement of the local citizenship, which has been reached in particular with the Open Data Challenge experience. The citizens contributed to the creation of public value, in collaboration with the local Public Administration, by discussing topics in the context of the local Cultural Heritage. They generated information both from pre-existing and co-created open datasets, using the SPOD platform. These experiences represent a bottom-up approach that directly involves the citizenship in a series of crowdsourcing activities in the field of the Cultural Heritage, collecting data and disseminating the gained knowledge to the whole community."

A comprehensive functionality test, surveys and interviews with suppliers and users in local authorities of both countries have been conducted, together with policy document analyses. While in Denmark open document standards have been bindingly introduced by legislation, Germany adopts a blended top-down and bottom-up approach, only providing recommendations. Although, as a result, it seems that Denmark ranks much higher in the adoption of open document standards, the overall picture is blurrier, as for instance only a small minority of public employees use open source software. The authors also suggest that the need for open standards might actually be overstated, as the rapid adoption of e.g. the PDF document format has made it in practice almost irrelevant."

Currently, some citizens are very politically active and are taking part in the legislative process, starting petitions and protests to stop or support particular bills. However, the majority of the population is lost and does not care much for the details of the legislative process. They get politically active when journalists and news outlets raise an issue, but this is intrinsically biased towards the media's agenda and not always close to the citizen's personal interests. We are researching ways to automatically summarize and simplify the legislative process in a personalized manner for each citizen. In the way that Netflix or Amazon can learn a customer's preferences for movies, books and other products, we have been researching methods to build a system that can learn political preferences and topic of interest and can use these to automatically notify citizens when such topics are being discussed in parliament or when a bill is being voted that the citizen would strongly support or oppose. In this paper we present the state of the open data that is currently made available by legislative bodies to bootstrap such a system and we then discuss a particular use case, Cidadão Automatico that we are developing for monitoring the Brazilian legislative bodies."

In this chapter, a framework for evidence based policy making is proposed, which integrates the usage of open big data coming from a multiplicity of sources with policy simulations. It encompasses the application of dynamic modelling methodologies and data mining techniques to extract knowledge from two types of data. On the one hand, objective data such as governmental and statistical data, are used to capture the interlinked policy domains and their underlying casual mechanisms. On the other hand, behavioural patterns and citizens' opinions are extracted from Web 2.0 sources, social media posts, polls and statistical surveys. To combine this multimodal information, our approach suggests a modelling methodology that bases on big data acquisition and processing for the identification of significant factors and counterintuitive interrelations between them, which can be applied in any policy domain. Then, to allow the practical application of the framework an ICT architecture is designed, with the aim to overcome challenges related with big data management and processing. Finally, validation of the approach for driving policy design and implementation in the future in diverse policy domains, is suggested."

Such approaches allow the exploitation of their opinions, which incorporate valuable perceptions of them, as well as knowledge, proposals and ideas. This paper outlines three advanced methods of social media (SM) exploitation in public policy making processes for citizen-sourcing, which are based on the concepts of active citizen-sourcing, passive citizen-sourcing and passive expert-sourcing respectively, as well as the conclusions from some first applications of them. Based on them a comparison of these methods is conducted, and then a maturity model is developed concerning the use of SM for citizen-sourcing in order to support policy making."

However, lack of citizens’ trust seems to be a main obstacle that hinders its successful realization. In this paper we propose a trust-centered engineering approach for building eVoting systems that people can trust, based on transparent design and implementation phases. The approach is based on three components: the decomposition of eVoting systems into “layers of trust” for reducing the complexity of managing trust issues in smaller manageable layers, the application of a risk analysis methodology able to identify and document security critical aspects of the eVoting system, and a cryptographically secure eVoting protocol. Our approach is pragmatic rather than theoretical in the sense that it sidesteps the controversy that besets the nature of trust in information systems and starts with a working definition of trust as people’s positive attitude towards a system that performs its operations transparently."

It aims better, faster, convenient, and cost-effective services to citizens, business, and employees. The revolution of ICT with the citizens changing demands enforced e-Government (EG) researchers and practitioners for developing new skills, competencies, capabilities, and knowledge to respond to changes in its service delivery environment. This requirement rooted to achieve an agile EG system (EGS). Since the business environment of enterprises is undergoing rapid changes, researchers are trying to find an appropriate approach toward the creation of an enterprise agility to cope with this vicissitudes. Transforming the traditional enterprise model to Service-Oriented Enterprise Architecture (SOEA) is one of the best state-of-the-art solutions for an organization to get agile. It is the evolution of Enterprise Architecture style and it integrate the business and IT logic to create an agile enterprise system. This research adopted this philosophy and applied in the EGS. The researcher proposed a Service-Oriented e-Government Enterprise Architecture to achieve agile EG system in view of Indian context. Government of India has taken various EG initiatives with high importance given to citizen-centric service delivery, but they are islands of attempts in the absence of interoperability. The proposed approach is capable to solve the interoperability and integration issues of EGS and is illustrated using a public service provided by Government of India."

This research paper explores the origin, added value and future position of these intermediary organisations with respect to the delivery of e-government services to businesses. Results indicate that (re-)intermediation is more likely to occur within this context than disintermediation is. SME’s do not want to be captured within a non-profitable electronic hierarchical relationship with a governmental organisation. The empirical study on the impact of the legal obligation of the use of e-tax services illustrates that SME’s instead prefer the ‘save haven’ of a commercial relationship with an intermediary service provider.

These are issues where development is open for local choice, influences of strong stakeholders, and chance. This situation is a consequence of the prevailing strategic model for the public sector, New Public Manage ment. This model by design leaves these issues in a void which has to be filled by negotiations among many actors with different roles, goals, and action space. The general lesson is that the void needs to be filled strategically; to reduce the risk level and increase the ability to implement policy or it will be open for unexpected turns of events."

In Sweden e-government efforts are motivated by dual goals of citizen benefit and agencies’ internal efficiency. Rhetorical, this is a persuasive ambition, but in practice it seems to be easier to focus agency efficiency and redesign of business processes and information systems than to find out what citizens really want. Citizens, i.e. the future users of the e-service, are in best case represented in the project by citizen organizations. More seldom do individual citizens take part in the project. User needs are, thus, sometimes “guessed” instead of analyzed. We report from an e-government project which started with little understanding of the future users. To overcome this we introduced focus groups as a method to meet and talk to citizens and find out their needs regarding the e-service.

The purpose of this article is to illustrate the fact that, besides the aim to increase agency efficiency and citizen benefit, e-government implementation might also change the salience of involved stakeholders. We do this by focusing on one stakeholder group which was reluctant and hesitating in the beginning of the studied project; marginalized, passive, easily convinced, and old-fashioned. After the e-government implementation, this group had turned to satisfied, proud, influential, active, powerful, and modern IT users. The case shows how stakeholder salience might change over time in an e-government project. Stakeholder influence aspects and IT driven change aspects are intertwined. This makes it necessary for any e-government project to address the notion of stakeholder involvement in decision-making during the development and implementation phases, but also to acknowledge e-services force to change how things and people are perceived during these phases."

Low social capital has been confirmed as one of the main reasons for this decrease in trust towards government. As social media offer a number of features that could foster social capital, governments worldwide are embracing these new tools in an attempt to restore citizens' trust. Having an existence on social media doesn't guarantee that it would increase trust; it can even compromise on the reputation of a public agency in the absence of a clear strategy targeted towards developing confidence and trust. To ensure the reflection of this strategy on the content of governmental social media, there should be a mechanism that measures the degree of trust on social media in government taking into account different aspects related to trust. Despite the importance of this kind of evaluation, it is though overlooked in both academia and practice. This paper therefore aims to fill this research gap through suggesting a standard technique to measure different trust dimensions on social media accounts of governments. A proposed framework for evaluating trust was applied on Facebook accounts of three Egyptian ministries - selected based on their apparent contribution to the national economy- taking into account six dimensions of trust: Responsiveness, Accessibility, Transparency, Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Participation."

Based on the results, the paper further presents recommendations on how URA can fix current usability gaps to make the portal more effective, efficient and satisfying to use. This is hoped to attract and retain more tax payers in the country to use it as opposed to continuing to use the traditional manual system which is not only costly, but also reduces the level of compliance. Furthermore, a usable eTax portal will decrease training, support and maintenance costs. The paper also provides general recommendations on how to develop and manage more usable websites."

Therefore we identify a need for developing theory for the design of government control procedures. Some research has been done on designing inter-organizational controls in B2B transactions. In this paper we argue that with certain modifications control principles used in B2B are also suitable for the Government-to-Business context, and we present a conceptual model for designing government controls in G2B, based on earlier work of Bons.

The project is implemented by the Government with the participation of the private sector where the operations and maintenance of the service centers in the state are outsourced. The project is sustained through the collection of user charges by the private sector, and so, attracts a levy of service tax and presently, the goods and service tax. The study analyzes the impact of the tax on the revenue flow to the service providers and the village level entrepreneurs in the project. Using data from the office of the ESD-Meeseva, the study finds that the tax squeezes the margins for the service providers and the entrepreneurs which affects its commercial viability, and creates dead weight loss which adversely impacts societal welfare. While making out a case for eliminating the tax levy, the study suggests alternative options for improving the efficiency of the citizen-oriented electronic services."

Based on a case study of an e-government project, the aligned concepts are applied using the dynamic network diagram technique. As a result, dependencies, governance mechanisms, dependency power and securing mechanisms are discussed as enhancements to existing concepts and methods.

Towards Benefit Realization Planning",NA,"10.1007/978-3-319-22479-4_18","The effective management of stakeholders’ benefits is crucial for the success of e-government projects. This success can be expressed as the match between realized project benefits and their anticipation by stakeholders according to their expectations. Unfortunately, recent studies report that there is often a mismatch between realized and expected benefits. Hence, understanding the reason for this mismatch would be of value for theory and practice. Guided by stakeholder and resource dependency theory, we aim at explaining this mismatch. Therefore, benefit aspects to be considered during realization planning are derived from literature. Based on these aspects, we interpret four types of benefits in a study of an e-government project in a German public administration: project guiding, endangered, questioned and out-of-focus benefits. We suggest that a mismatch between realized and expected benefits results from issues concerning particular benefit types and provide conjectures for effective management in practice."

Still, standardization struggles with the complexity of administrative procedures that have to be supported and provided online. Managing this complexity poses a crucial challenge for an efficient and effective eGovernment. Different management frameworks have been developed, but the progress of standardization in practice is still perceived as insufficient. To address the challenge of standardization management in eGovernment, we propose a coordination theory based framework for analysis. It consists of three coordination modes distinguished based on their mechanisms and relevant context dimensions. In our research approach, we interpret a single case study of a standardization project in Germany where artefacts were developed from a pragmatism perspective. We discuss our findings and conclude on implications for research and practice."

The transparency sought through information sharing contributes to the trust of various stakeholders such as citizens, other organizations and enterprises in such institutions. Information sharing, on the other hand, may increase the chance of privacy breaches due to, for example, information leakage and information fusion. Such privacy breaches can undermine stakeholders' trust and thus work against the purpose of gaining trust through transparency. Moreover, fear of potential privacy breaches compels information disseminators to share minimum or no information. In this contribution we show that creating transparency through sharing information in the context of our public judiciary organization is a typical wicked problem. Subsequently we explain (the outcomes of) our designerly approach to design and intervene three artifacts within our organization. These artifacts are aimed at disseminating our judiciary data in a privacy preserving way, as privacy preservation contributes positively to the information sharing. Through addressing the privacy problem we try to address the transparency problem."

Often this is the case when the data is of low quality, has (potentially) sensitive information, or has non-interoperable data format and semantics. Not being able to (completely) satisfy the Open Data requirements may have made such organizations to appear incompliant with the ideals and objectives of Open Data, despite their full commitments and efforts for data opening. In this contribution we propose a new paradigm -- called Semi-Open Data paradigm -- in order to frame, acknowledge, and encourage such initiatives and efforts that strive along the Open Data objectives but do not comply with Open Data requirements completely due to some practical constraints. For the proposed Semi-Open Data paradigm we further present an assessment method to measure and categorize Semi-Open Data initiatives objectively. This method offers a better way to assess and reward the extent of organizations' efforts to meet the Open Data characteristics than the current method that checks whether all Open Data requirements are met or not (i.e., by making a binary decision)."

Data dissemination, however, increases chance of compromising privacy sensitive data, which undermines trust of data subjects (e.g., users and citizens). Data disseminators are morally, ethically, and legally responsible for any misuse of the disseminated data. Therefore, privacy enhancement techniques are often used to prevent unsavory disclosure of personal data. Data recipients, nevertheless, are sometimes able to derive (part of) privacy sensitive information by, for example, fusing the shared data with other data. This can be considered as a sort of data misuse. In this contribution, we investigate how having a feedback from data recipients to data disseminators is instrumental for detecting such data misuses (i.e., privacy breaches). We also elaborate on using feedback for defining and deriving context-dependent privacy-preferences of data disseminators. In this case, feedback acts as a means of privacy prevention. We provide a categorization of existing feedback based solutions and, in addition, describe our implementation of a feedback-based data dissemination solution in an eGovernment setting. Finally, we elaborate on the importance of real-time partial feedback mechanisms, as a rising and promising solution direction for preserving privacy."

They facilitate the design of high-quality concrete architectures and the communication between domain professionals. The reference architecture approach should be applied in the smart city domain because of its complexity where different stakeholders and heterogeneous systems and technologies must coexist and interact. Smart cities reference architectures should offer a cooperative framework for stakeholders and a guide to design concrete architectures. Industry and academia have proposed different requirements for concrete architectures. However, there is a lack of standardization in the requirements for the design of smart city reference architectures. This can produce that concrete architectures do not meet citizens’ requirements. The goal of this paper is to define a set of requirements for the design of smart city reference architectures. We conduct a literature review to find the requirements which should fulfil these reference architectures."

However, blockchain adoption and use in the context of e-Government is rather unexplored in academic literature. In this paper, we systematically review relevant research to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain adoption for e-Government. The results show that the adoption of blockchain-based applications in e-Government is still very limited and there is a lack of empirical evidence. The main challenges faced in blockchain adoption are predominantly presented as technological aspects such as security, scalability and flexibility. From an organizational point of view, the issues of acceptability and the need of new governance models are presented as the main barriers to adoption. Moreover, the lack of legal and regulatory support is identified as the main environmental barrier of adoption. Based on the challenges presented in the literature, we propose future research questions that need to be addressed to inform how the public sector should approach the blockchain technology adoption."

Results show that the level of economic development has a moderate impact on the e-government development, while national competitiveness and innovation play quite a strong role. There is also a low correlation between overall government efficiency and e-government. It confirms that e-government projects are predominantly politically and not economic or socially driven. However, the most economically advanced Nordic countries and UK have all very high e-government readiness. On the other hand, there is surprisingly low correlation between e-government usage by enterprises and individuals, which indicates very different incentives for business and the public. The relatively low performance of new EU member states was also noted."

However, until today these possibilities remain largely unexploited. To measure the impact of ICT-investments all processes of a public administration have to be taken into account. The PICTURE modelling method has been proposed as a way to efficiently model the whole process landscape of a public administration. Based on the processes captured, the impact of certain ICT functionalities can be analyzed. ICT investment decisions become more transparent towards the political leadership which are the decision makers in the public sector.

BI is of special interest in the context of introducing accrual accounting in public administrations as this affects the information level of different stakeholders, leading to a possible decrease for municipal councils. The principal-agent theory can help to explain different behavioral intentions of the stakeholders concerning the introduction of BI. We employ a single qualitative case study to analyze these behavioral intentions. It shows that the introduction of accrual accounting did decrease the information level of the municipal council making the principal-agent problems possible. Furthermore, it shows that BI might be a solution for this problem. Therefore, council members show the behavioral intention to support the BI implementation while administration staff members rather resist it. Based on these finding, we discuss implications for practice and future research."

In doing so, we analyse three different newspapers concerning their way of reporting on IT risks and security issues in eGovernment systems using the method of content analysis. It shows that their news coverage is indeed quite biased and emotional possibly influencing the readers’ attitudes towards eGovernment systems.

Thus being, this paper was oriented by this research question: how do public administrations deal with the treatment of personal data? For answering this question it was developed a framework whose primordial aim was to evaluate to what extent the Smart Cities projects adopt measures to ensure that the citizen has control on the data collected by the Administration (Digital Sovereignty). For the elaboration of this study it was used the method of monographic procedure, making essentially use of the research technique based on relevant literature review on Smart Cities, Governance and Data Protection. To the employment of these techniques it was added the case study, confronting theory with the practice undertaken by Operations Centre of Rio de Janeiro (OCR) and Integrated Management Centre of Porto (IMCP) concerning the governance of collected user's personal data. The preliminary results arising out of the application of an inquiry revealed that both OCR and IMCP do not present clear information on the treatment of the user's data neither in government portals nor as feedback, since they did not reply to the sent form.

We report preliminary findings from an ongoing study of the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa that revealed breakdowns in governance due in part to limited use of digital technologies to support systematic monitoring of the spread of the disease, search for, and exchange of, valid information and knowledge essential to manage a rapidly evolving, complex threat. We apply a systems theory approach to this wicked problem as a framework for examining the interactions between key actors involved in the response to this epidemic. Preliminary findings are drawn from a content analysis of news articles posted on the United Nations Relief Web and include a chronological record of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa from March through December 2014. A planned network analysis will measure the centrality of actors, as well as the strength and direction of ties among the participating actors: local, provincial, national, regional, and international. We anticipate developing a model of sociotechnical design for addressing complex policy problems"

There is no single approach to e-government, with a range of e-government applications and set of e-government technologies in effect. Agencies and levels of government have different mandates and approaches regarding e-government, leaving users on their own to identify and resolve their e-government needs. Without a bridge between previously mediated interactions, users often make their way to libraries and rely on librarian expertise to fulfill their e-government needs. This paper explores the ability of libraries and government agencies to collaborate effectively in the provision of e-government to residents and communities in this country, presenting findings from a national survey of U.S. public libraries, and interviews and case sites conducted with 15 public libraries in four states."

In addition, demographic changes, population growth, population mobility, and other community factors create further pressures to ensure an inclusive society that provides access and opportunity for all. This paper presents the results of a national survey of public libraries in the United States as a community-based agency for building digitally inclusive communities. The paper finds that U.S. public libraries provide essential services such as free access to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), broadband, digital literacy skills, and facilitate access to economic, learning, health, and civic engagement opportunities -- all key aspects of Digital Inclusion (DI). The paper also finds that there is a relationship between the physical space and the ability of libraries to provide digital services. Finally, the paper outlines the need for additional research, particularly in the area of the impact of library DI services on the UN Sustainability Goals (e.g., poverty, equity, and inclusion)."

At the same time, governments have significant fiscal constraints on their ability to address these challenges and opportunities. Through a combination of open government, open data, and civic engagement, however, governments, citizens, civil society groups, and others are reinventing the relationship between governments and the governed by developing crowdsourced and other innovative solutions for community advancement. Underlying this reinvention and innovation is data -- particularly local data about housing, air quality, graduation rates, literacy rates, poverty, disease, and more. And yet, not all communities have the capacity to create, work with, or leverage data at the local level. Using a case study approach in a medium-sized U.S. city, this paper focuses on the issues that smaller communities face when seeking to create local data infrastructures and the extent to which libraries can develop their capabilities, capacity, and abilities to work with community information and data to facilitate community engagement and high-impact, locally relevant analytics."

The framework builds on the foundations of public sector innovation and Digital Government Evolution model. In line with the latter, the paper equips each innovation with sharp logical characterization, body of research literature and real-life cases from around the world to simultaneously serve the illustration and validation goals. The paper also identifies some policy implications of the framework, covering a broad range of issues from infrastructure, capacity, eco-system and partnerships, to inclusion, value, channels, security, privacy and authentication."

Their main goals are to ease the reporting burden for businesses and the regulatory burden for government agencies. This paper takes a look at the adoption numbers in the Netherlands over multiple years. The objective of this paper is to analyse the adoption rates and explain them by revealing the steering instruments employed by government agencies looking to positive-ly influence SBR adoption. Our dataset consists of the total number of reports submitted using SBR towards the Tax Office, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Education Executive Agency. Quantitative data analysis reveals different adoption rates and patterns in the aforementioned reporting chains. We found that adoption was positively influenced using a deliberate and fine-tuned set of steering instruments, including public-private governance, open communication and knowledge exchange, mandation, software community engagement and technical configuration (use of interfaces that match the sector specific reporting capabilities). When considering these steering instruments, policy makers and practitioners need to balance progressive standard setting and steady implementation."

While the body of knowledge on commercial MSPs is steadily growing, little empirical substantiation exists about the series of design choices that stakeholders conduct in order to realize information infrastructures in a public-private setting. This paper investigates the barriers and decisions that influence the public-private design of MSPs. Two public-private initiatives are investigated: (1) standard business reporting and (2) an international logistic information platform. The barriers and decisions in the current portrayal of both cases are analysed on two aspects: (1) the platform governance and (2) the information infrastructure. Research data is collected through knowledge retention projects in which researchers and practitioners reflect on design choices. We found that rather than developing an information infrastructure and demanding that businesses use it, government agencies detach from the classical approach and actively tempt businesses to partner in achieving long-term goals. A cross-case comparison shows that in the public-private setting government agencies need to employ a careful mix of instruments (i.e., business incentives, legislation and standard development) in order to realise successful information infrastructures. Both government agencies and businesses are still learning in terms of employing MSPs for realising change."

During crises, information demand and supply are often unbalanced, leading to situations in which relief workers are faced with incorrect, outdated or incomplete information. To address such challenges, network-centric operations (NCO), which involves information sharing with the socio-technical network as the central enabling mechanism, has been proposed. Yet, NCO is ill-understood and it is unclear whether the promised benefits can be realized in practice. In this paper we address the gap between the concept and reality of NCO. The necessary capabilities for NCO are identified using literature research and potential benefits are analyzed using field research. We found that NCO is not a silver bullet for overcoming the inherent problems of crisis management and could even reinforce existing problems. Our findings suggest that NCO is difficult to implement and needs to be complemented with capability development in the information and cognitive domain."

The vision is to transform the EC government landscape into a coherent community, which anticipates customer needs and leverages the potential of the diversity and innovativeness of public agencies. In this paper, we give an overview of the scenario building methodology and develop a first set of scenarios using trend analysis. Four scenarios are derived showing different futures on e-government in 2020. The scenarios contain different aspects of integration, decentralization and centralization of power and governmental departments, democratizing systems and the role of individualisms and collectivism in society.

For classification, the neural network-based Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization-Improved (GRLVQI) classifier is employed. GRLVQI has shown high fidelity in classifying Z-Wave RF Fingerprints; however, GRLVQI has multiple hyperparameters. Prior work optimized GRLVQI via a full factorial experimental design. Herein, optimizing GRLVQI via stochastic approximation, which operates by iterative searching for optimality, is of interest to provide an unconstrained optimization approach to avoid limitations found in full factorial experimental designs. The results provide an improvement in GRLVQI operation and accuracy. The methodology is further generalizable to other problems and algorithms."

However, there is still a lack of understanding of internal users' reactions to new information systems, and in particular to new e-government systems. In light of this deficit, this research study draws on the Coping Model of User Adaption (CMUA) to examine the adaptation strategies of middle managers in public bodies when new e-government initiatives are implemented in their work place. We report on the preliminary findings of an initial qualitative case study of one such initiative. We believe that studying internal users' adaptation strategies is beneficial because these strategies influence the extent to which benefits arise from new electronic services provided by governments."

In these participations, Governments generally ask people to give their opinions with regard to particular subjects. Governments then consider these opinions in their decision-making process. With the emergence of new ICTs that are widely spread and used by citizens, Government made a shift from face-to-face citizens' participation to an electronic citizens' participation or the so-called e-participation. In this context, governments need to identify the best means to achieve electronic participation in a way and a time that gives the citizens the opportunity to have a real influence on the decisions to be made. However, the literature shows that there is no consensus about these means. This paper is an attempt to examine, through an extensive literature review, the current state of the art about e-Participation. Results show that social welfare is the dominant domain in which e-Participation was conducted. They show also that social media technologies are the most used to conduct e-Participation initiatives."

Through an extensive survey of the relevant literature, this research seeks to build an initial framework of public value as applied to co-created open data. Grounded in the structured literature review technique, the authors surveyed the pertinent literature to identify the primary factors that enable value co-creation from the citizens point of view.

This research investigates whether this initiative has affected both the providers of the information and its supposed audience -- the public, as represented by citizen groups. To answer the questions, the researchers made use of a case study approach by selecting three provinces as research sites which yielded two major findings. On the supply side, incentivising openness is a critical aspect in ensuring that local governments have the interest to disclose financial data. However, on the demand side, there is limited awareness on the part of the public, and more particularly the intermediaries (e.g. business groups, civil society organizations, research institutions), on the availability of data, and thus, its limited use. This paper argues that openness is not just about governments putting meaningful government data out into the public domain, but also about making the public meaningfully engage with governments. This requires policies that will require observance of open government data standards and a capacity building process of ensuring that the public, to whom the data is intended, are aware and able to use the data in ensuring more transparent and accountable governance."

We then move on to look at recent technological developments in the field of Online Dispute Resolution to argue that these can, in the near future, have a significant role in improving access to Justice. Specifically, we analyze the UMCourt Conflict Resolution Framework, developed by our research team, and address the different dimensions in which such tools contribute to make Justice more accessible, namely through better access to useful information, support in decision-making or more cost-effective processes."

Despite the benefits of e-government - increased government accountability to citizens, greater public access to information, and a more efficient, cost-effective government - the success and acceptance of e-government initiatives, such as online voting and license renewal, are contingent upon citizens' willingness to adopt this innovation. In order to develop ""citizen-centered"" e-government services that provide citizens with accessible, relevant information and quality services that are more expedient than traditional ""brick and mortar"" transactions, government agencies must first understand the factors that influence citizen adoption of this innovation. This study integrates constructs from the technology acceptance model (TAM), diffusions of innovation theory (DOI) and Web trust model to form a parsimonious, yet comprehensive model of factors that influence citizen adoption of electronic government initiatives. The findings and implications of this study are discussed in the paper."

In this paper we re-examined the hypothesis that a citizen having higher digital and administrative literacy would more frequently and with a higher success rate use e-government services. We analysed the collected applications received to a tender conducted by a public housing institution for renting flats under favourable conditions to citizens. The concerned citizens were intentionally offered two possibilities for submitting their applications: in paper form by the ordinary mail or in electronic form via the internet. The electronic web form was designed to be simple and easy to access, use and navigate; submitting and completing the application for renting flats through the web was of the same, if not of the lesser, complexity than filling and sending the same application by the ordinary mail. Contrary to a popular belief that the electronic submission would be typically preferred by more digitally and administrative literate citizens, the results of our study indicate that the completeness of submitted applications by the ordinary mail was significantly better than the completeness of the applications submitted via the web form. There is an agreement that citizens' digital literacy has to reach a certain level in order to start successfully using the available e-government services. However, our results indicate that a high digital literacy might not be enough. In some cases it not only ceases to help, but might also degrade the overall performance and success of a citizen using e-government services."

The aim of public policy used by the state Housing Fund for distributing social housing facilities in Slovenia is to ensure transparent and equally fair treatment of all beneficiaries. During the last decade the Fund has established a sustainable structure for policy models that consist of three parts: written requirements for applications, a detailed process description, and a comprehensive decision support model containing rules for ranking the applications according to their priority. In this paper we analyze the main causes of changes in the policy in the last decade and investigate how they are reflected in the underlying conceptual and decision support models. The results of our analysis indicate that the key critical success factor was to maintain a delicate balance between the sustainability of the models and changes in the policy. As a result, the state housing Fund was able to leverage the supply on the Slovenian housing market by efficiently conducting twelve consecutive tenders for offering apartments under favorable terms to citizens."

After attempting a positioning of municipality systems in the taxonomy of e-government systems, the present paper analyses the set of services that a Municipality Portal should be able to offer, focusing on eEurope - related capabilities. Based on this service directory, a multi-faceted classification mechanism is proposed, leading to an extendible taxonomy of e-Services to be offered by Municipality e-Government systems. A set of facets is analysed for each service, allowing for classification of services based on their main purpose, nature, orientation, means of provision, and various functional characteristics. Through populating, viewing and querying this multi-faceted classification, the design, development, deployment and impact assessment of e-Government systems for Municipalities can be systematically addressed."

Such ‘Padgets’ are created by a central platform-toolset and then deployed in many different Web 2.0 media. Citizens input from them will be used in various simulation modeling techniques and tools (such as the ‘Systems Dynamics’), which are going to simulate different policy options and estimate their outcomes and effectiveness.

The research questions underlying the present paper are: which new ICT-enabled governance models and methods of monitoring, interaction, collaboration for policy making and enforcement are emerging, and which policy modelling mechanisms can be implemented in order to effectively involve citizens in decision making? The paper starts addressing these issues by defining the problem statement and discussing the changing role of the government in the Information Society, also proposing some elements for a conceptualisation of ICT for governance and policy modelling. It further presents the evolving debate on the e-Government and e-Governance agenda developments, as well as the state of the art and the limitations of research in these fields.

Private individuals increasingly become both providers and consumers of services. Web 2.0 enables peer-to-peer transactions between consumers creating a new consumption space with hundreds of mediator platforms. While the new legally questionable market is typically seen as a challenge by governments, the opportunities for governments to participate in peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and collaborative consumption services (SCCS) for their citizens are hardly explored in academia. In contrast, first pioneer governments such as the cities of Seoul and San Francisco have already developed strategies to support the development of P2P SCCS for their citizens. In this work, we advocate for extending the function scope of e-government by including P2P SCCS into its portfolio. To support our reasoning and in order to systematically address the problem area emerging from the combination of e-government and P2P SCCS, we review and synthesize e-government models and relate them to the P2P SCCS phenomenon. Our results reveal what constitutes a research agenda for utilizing potentials of P2P SCCS in the context of e-government research and practice."

These security mechanisms had been sufficient to ensure secure exchange of information between two organizations, preventing illegal modification, edits, or transfers of sensitive data to a third parties for unintended purposes in the age of wired PC based computing environment. However, with a wide spread use of mobile devices and micro devices, including smart phones and wearable devices, additional security mechanisms are required to prevent the insider attacks, such as a leakage of highly sensitive and confidential documents or conversations by taking secretive photos or illegal recordings. In this paper, we present the Smart SecureGov framework that focuses on the tracking technologies in case of smart device-based leakage occurs. The security mechanisms, such as a text watermarking technology, image or audio watermarking technologies, are proposed to detect the authenticity of the leaked document or media and to trace back to the origin of leaks.

In this paper, we focus on the structuration process of an e-government innovation, particularly the society-wide structuration through which enabled technical features are given meaning and legal institutionalization of use. Through the case, we found that an e-government system adopted for efficiency may suffer from the lack of an appropriate supporting legal structure, pushing the system into instability. We also found that the sophistication of an e-government system is based not only on its technological features but also on the evolution of social discourse.

One particular challenge associated to urban population growth refers to transportation systems, and as an approach to face it, governments are investing significant efforts enhancing public transport services. An important aspect of public transport is ensuring that licensing of such services fulfill existing government regulations. Due to the differences in government regulations, and to the difficulties in ensuring the fulfillment of their specific features, many local governments develop tailored Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions to automate the licensing of public transport services. In this paper we propose an ontology for licensing such services following the REFSENO methodology. In particular, the ontology captures common concepts involved in the application and processing stage of licensing public bus passenger services. The main contribution of the proposed ontology is to define a common vocabulary to share knowledge between domain experts and software engineers, and to support the definition of a software product line for families of public transport licensing services."

As the Brazilian case is analyzed, it also approaches the question of territorial heterogeneity and its effects. Methodology consisted of comparative analysis of the transparency indexes among the three different spheres of government: municipalities, states and central government. Observation of 125 public administration websites reveals that the more limited the sphere of government, the lower the level of transparency is. In other words, Brazilian central government is more transparent than the state ones, and these, in turn, are more transparent than the municipal governments. These differences do not corroborate the maxim employed by supporters of the federalism that local governments tend to establish closer relations with citizens. Furthermore, integrated action among all the government spheres may be recommendable to obtain better transparency outcomes."

The implantation of ERP and the client-consultant relationship have been thoroughly discussed for the private sector, but have yet to be well understood in a government context. To understand this dynamic, the theoretical framework of Pozzebon and Pinsonneault has been used, which suggests that knowledge and power are shared and negotiated during the implementation of configurable technologies such as ERP. The findings show a dynamic of cooperation between client and consultant due to mutual necessity, with diverse mechanisms of knowledge and power that influence the relationship. Between them, mechanisms that may be exclusive to the government scenario: the common language, the involvement of an external agent in the project and the external IT team. The study examines the application of the theoretical framework in a public sector context, providing insight concerning the client-consultant relationship in an arena where public expenditure on consultancy and management tends to increase. Owing to the particular nature of government, the study provides insight that can benefit governments and consultants in the implementation of successful ERP."

Typically homogeneous Public Administrations, such as municipalities, have to provide the same services to all citizens. Nevertheless their concrete implementation, and the supporting Business Process model and data object models, can slightly differ from one Public Administration to the other due to organizational factors. If such variability is not explicitly represented and managed, each office will have to reflect on and analyse the requirements posed by the delivery of the service; then they will have to derive a specific process and data model. On the other hand the explicit modeling of variability can reduce the work to be done and permits to define general specifications from which specific model variants can be derived according to specific needs. In this paper we propose a novel approach, inspired by Feature Modeling techniques, for data object variability modeling that can be used to provide high level blueprints from which detailed Business Processes and data object specifications can be derived. Finally, a complex scenario has been applied to validate the approach with encouraging results."

The contribution focuses on how laws and regulations are re-designed into ICTs and the effect this design process has on the performance of public sector organisations. The paper builds on the concepts of functional simplification and closure to depict the particular process by which ICTs moulds laws and regulations. The case of the justice sector is discussed as exemplificative example to discuss how law and ICTs negotiate the regulation of organisational activities into techno-legal assemblages. Building on the finding of the case the paper provides a new dimension to be accounted for when the enactment of ICTs occurs in public sector organisations. The paper suggests that the technical, the legal, as well as the institutional properties that shape e-government projects need to be considered to better understand the impacts of e-government reforms on public sector organizations, the services they deliver, and the value that is generated for the citizens receiving public services."

Open Data (OD) initiatives are achieving less citizens' engagement than expected. Hence, the need to find other ways and services to obtain more engagement and extract value from OD. This paper introduces an architectural model to design software platforms with the objective to increase public value through collective participation of citizens, public administrations and key stakeholders. The architectural model originates from the Data-Information-Knowledge hierarchy, where greater value is at the top of the pyramid, in information and knowledge gathered from data. Thus, the architectural model adds the collaborative and presentation layers to the classical data layer; citizens, public administrations, and stakeholders form groups of interests to understand, reason and interpret Open Data to gather information and generate knowledge that will be communicated to the general audience over Internet, thus, increasing public value. The paper describes three platform instances: the ROUTE-TO-PA ecosystem, the data.world, and DKAN, which functionalities can be mapped onto the architectural model proposed in the paper. Furthermore, the paper describes HETOR, a concreate experience of exploitation of the architectural model and the ROUTE-TO-PA ecosystem with groups of students and associations of citizens, who collaborated together to ultimately generate new knowledge for Cultural Heritage to be communicated over Internet through blog posts."

In this paper, focusing on run-time composition of e-services, we provide an approach that reduces the possibility that the system will fail as consequence of interoperability issues among run-time discovered services, and after that sensible data have been provided by the citizen. The approach uses run-time testing to assess interoperability between services, and model-checking based techniques to reduce the number of test-cases to be applied.

Brazil, as one of the eight founding countries, has implemented a series of actions to open its government. One of these key actions is its Access to Information Law. The Brazilian law established a legal framework of guidelines for opening data from all levels of government in the country, in addition to considering internet and transparency portals key elements for the consolidation of open government. In this scenario, local governments built websites dedicated to transparency without observing the law requirements and, consequently, Open Government Data (OGD) principles. This paper shows a comprehensive assessment of transparency websites through a survey with 20 municipalities. The Brazilian law requirements are used as evaluation criteria because they somehow cover OGD principles. Our results show a gap between local transparency portals and the effective implementation of the OGD principles. This gap leads to a misconception that transparency portals are dissociated from the open government initiative, which is not true."

In this context, transparency web sites appear as distributed silos of documents with heterogeneous and often unstructured data, in which the information provided is mainly through HTML and PDF formats. Although they seem to be the preferred formats to disclose data, they lack the machine-readability feature advocated by OGD. This concern is easily addressed with the use of current OGD portals which provide a straightforward manner to fully implement public openness with data; thus, government work processes should be redesigned to consider the OGD principles from data creation. However, some time will lag until cultural transformations make data really open. This paper proposes an architecture composed of a collaborative-oriented middleware for structuring information in the ""as is"" format while governments are prepared to fully comply with OGD. We describe all the main components through an implementation point of view. With the likely use of this architecture, we provide society with a way to press for opening data before governments do."

Beginning with the United States' Freedom of Information Act, the article then traces the influence of U.S. electronic government records legislation and norms that developed during the eighties and nineties. In particular, the concept of ""value-added"" from the financial sector reconfigured government records as ""raw data"" that could be enhanced and made operable through software interfaces. The Reagan administration and commercial vendors viewed ""value-added"" software as a proprietary venture that used strict licenses and copyright to wrench profit from government records while closing them off to wide public access. Open data, in contrast, reconciles government transparency with private sector expansion through open licenses and formats. In the rhetoric of open data, the monitory struggles against monopolistic electronic information technologies that took place in the eighties today align with the free market values of innovation and entrepreneurship touted by Silicon Valley."

The need for better visualization tools for environmental science is well-documented, but little prior work has been done to determine what kinds of visualizations work and with whom. The VISTAS research and development project has applied social science methods to this question, and has identified issues relevant to visualization software development, particularly where the application area involves wicked problems such as climate change. This paper presents visualization problems of scientists whose presentations of scientific results might be enhanced if they and software developers were consciously aware of the nature of so-called wicked problems and the considerations of non-scientist secondary users. While VISTAS focuses on visualization software, we believe results are generalizable to software in general. The primary lesson learned from our work is that extending the scope of the domain context will likely provide scientists with software that is more effective and relevant to non-scientist stakeholders, but that doing so can be time consuming and more costly unless the nature of the underlying science problem is recognized and characterized early in the product cycle."

Therefore, there is a concurrent need to develop and gain empirical support for models of technology acceptance within the public sector, and to examine technology acceptance and utilization issues among public employees to improve the success of IS implementation in this arena. In this paper we present a more comprehensive, yet parsimonious model of technology acceptance and suggest testing it both in public and private sectors to help understand the similarities and differences (if any) between the two sectors."

In the connected governance paradigm, public agencies share objectives across organizational boundaries, as opposed to working solely supporting autonomous portals in the e-government era. The establishment of connected governance poses new requirements, such as cross-organizational connectivity as well as back-office to front-office integration. Towards supporting this concept, we propose a Public Agency Networking Platform (PANP) facilitating personalized cross-organizational services, based on the concept of life events which represent human situations that trigger public services. The key feature of the platform is the simplification of the process execution workflow, as life events are accomplished through a user orchestrated process combining the functionality of discrete public agency applications. Emphasis has been laid on the citizen data protection by adopting a profile mechanism that enables the citizen to administer his/her own data loaded in his/her profile."

In this regard, a paradigm shift is proposed from New Public Management (NPM) to Digital-Era Governance (DEG). Moving from NPM to DEG entails a full socio-technical change, and it is necessary to investigate what new business models will be needed, and what the impact will be on management, strategy, and governance. This research investigates the implications of moving from NPM to DEG. First, by applying Action Design Research (ADR) in the context of a government lab to examine the implications on strategy in a DEG context. Second, this thesis investigates how the literature is paving the way towards DEG by performing a literature review on open data case studies. In this specific aspect of DEG transformation, focused on ecosystem platforms, it explores how knowledge-based interactions are fostered by open data platforms. Together with the understanding of how to design a DEG strategy, this contributes to a holistic view on how to move towards DEG."

Together with VDAB we apply an Action Design Research (ADR) approach to develop a set of ""boundary breaking rules"". Coining these simple rules represents a first significant step in VDAB's journey towards achieving a radical business innovation. In addition to the main artifact designed using our ADR approach in the VDAB context, i.e. the ""boundary breaking rules"", we derive lessons from this approach concerning the nature of this artifact specific for the VDAB case. Although this paper represents an early stage of the research and has not yet reached the final ADR stage of formalization of learning, we aim for it to lay the foundations for a more broadly applicable design theory of simple rules, useful in contexts generalizable from the specific VDAB context."

The methodology is iterative, incremental, evolutionary, test-driven, and collaborative. The novel idea is that PAs produce open data and, at same time, envision and anticipate possible uses and re-uses by citizens. The opportunity is that PAs will publish use cases along with Open Data as a way to engage citizens. The fit-for-use test is a specific step of the methodology in which PAs conceive possible uses of the dataset by creating a set of relevant visualisations (e.g., charts). This step mitigates some well-known barriers in the field of the OD, such as, that the data could be not accurate, not interesting, or too costly to be re-used [27]. The paper describes a platform named SPOD, based on the above agile methodology, meant to be used by PAs over their Intranet to support the collaborative process to make data publicly available. Moreover, the methodology and the SPOD have specific steps to assist PAs in checking the dataset quality through syntactic, sanity and domain-specific steps implemented through a set of heuristics. Both the methodology and the SPOD have been successfully adopted by the Council of the Campania Region in Italy to produce their open data, this experience has detailed described and reported in the paper."

Governments around the world are trying to find the best way to present their citizens with relevant information and transparency of public actions, expenditures, and investments. But how is this being approached in Brazil, in the federal, state, and municipal spheres of government? Objective: To find what initiatives are being conducted in Brazil, how open government data is being used, what types of data are most used in studies, and what are the challenges to implement open government data across the country through a systematic review of the literature. At last, based on the difficulties related to open government data, is suggested the first actions that should be taken to solve it. Method: A search on the main repositories to find literature that pertains to Open Government Data initiatives in Brazil, followed by a systematic review and classification of said literature. Results: There are not many research documents available that use open government data in the context of Brazil. Of those that exist, the main area that has studies on involve politicians and their expenses, and also education investments and results of said investments. Other subjects and uses of open government data are shown in this paper as a means to show that the interest in said data is spread across several areas. Conclusion: Many steps need to be done before an effective use of the government open datasets can be made. In most studies analyzed, researchers needed to take a first step of treatment of the data available before effectively using it. This one difficulty, if solved, would make a great impact on the use of government data. The conclusion of this paper is that there is much ground work that needs to be done yet to give companies and researchers a footing to make discoveries from the datasets."

However, many studies in the public sector field did not link innovation to existing theories. There are calls for a systemic approach to understand public sector innovation and its complexity, but there are few studies on how to develop a comprehensive analytical model that fits this need. This essay aims to contribute to fill this gap with the development of a theoretical framework to demonstrate how public sector innovations affects public value in a systemic context. We discuss that (1) Public Value Theory (PVT) is adherent to analyze public sector innovation, given its focus on the effects of government action; (2) public sector innovations foster the development of organizational capabilities (Public Service Delivery, Resource Acquisition, Co-production and Public Engagement), which in turn contribute to public value creation in a complex and intertwined manner better captured through System Dynamics. We argue that joining this theoretical fields can elucidate complex and non-linear relationships regarding public sector innovation, assisting scholars and public managers to understand aspects of the organizational environment that can increase or decrease the public value delivered to society over time."

Caste plays a strong role in determining community structures and political power. However, the role of caste as a factor in shaping e-governance design and outcomes is absent in the literature. This paper addresses this particular gap by examining some cases from India. The paper specifically considers whether the priorities of dominant caste groups determine e-governance design and implementations, to the exclusion of marginal and non-dominant castes. Further, it examines if e-governance introductions change or affect the relations of caste groups. The research relies on Structuration theory to provide a framework through which to study these issues. Data from three case studies from India are used to conduct the analysis, and these include the Bhoomi project from Karnataka, the Gyandoot project from Madhya Pradesh, and the VKC project from Puducherry. All three are information kiosk-based projects for providing e-governance services for citizens living in villages and rural areas."

In disaster management, social media data can be mined to discover public perceptions and concerns on large disaster events. However, converting large data streams into useful information remains a challenge due to the unstructured nature of textual data. This study proposes an interactive topic modeling method to analyze microblog data for understanding the dynamics of public expressions immediately after a major explosion event. First, we extract topics from microblog message data. In order to test the influence of the number of topics, the topics are detected at multiple levels of granularity by varying the number of topics. Second, these topics are used to detect topical compositions of contents at different time slices and assess the topic evolution over time. The topic evolution patterns are visualized by the streamgraph method to discover informative topics to help to take further actions. Third, since the first-level topics are not informative, we conduct a second-level topic (subtopic) analysis to detect key decision elements by choosing ""investigation"" from the first-level topics, a hot focus in any man-made disaster. The results improve our understanding of the topic composition evolution around major man-made disasters and have implications on officials deciding what and when to release formal investigation information to the public."

Usually such documents are difficult to read due to their nature, the length of sentences, complex terms used, etc. Since understanding is a prerequisite to making an informed decision, it is important to assess whether citizens, on average, would have the ability to comprehend those texts. We consider here that the authors of those documents should keep in mind their target audience and tailor their texts to their profiles. A good indicator that can be used in this context is the average education level of the citizens of a country. On the other hand, readability measures/scores of texts have been used to assess if educational material is suitable for the intended students' level of education attainment. In this paper, we use this information to assess the readability of terms of use of online services and correlate this information with the education attainment of the countries of their target audience. Our analysis shows that more efforts need to be put into making such policy documents understandable by a broader audience, uncovering a need for standards and tools in this area."

At its core are assumptions that diverse groups can provide wise answers to social queries, and that governments can utilize crowd-sourcing as a deliberative tool to improve policy decision-making. The use of data analytics for social networking sites like Twitter could inform policymaking if it could identify areas of potential agreement among a diverse group of individuals. This paper uses the De Groot learning model to test the capacity of online crowds to come to consensus about social problems. Using this model, and the Idle No More social movement as a case, this paper examines the degree that Twitter is a ""wise"" crowd in terms of its structure, meaning it is capable of sustaining an inclusive exchange of information over time. The paper finds that structurally, the Twitter network is the sort that can converge on a topic, however the larger the discussion, the more the network structure will be centralized, meaning small groups can dominate the messaging. However, influential actors change over time, suggesting that network structure may not matter as much as information flows across influential events."

Crowdfunding is also a political instrument in the hands of advocatory movements that efficiently disseminate ideas, concepts and information in ways never explore before through ""traditional"" information and communication channels. Crowdfunding is also becoming a channel of activating social capital. Besides the crowdfunding allows people to participate in the design, the improvement, the dissemination and the financing of the political and social campaigns, increasing hence the social capital of advocacy movements. The significant higher rate of success of those projects launched by advocatory movements, as compared to the general success rate of crowdfunding observed, suggest that the high level of engagement and involvement generated by social movements are crucial to understand success in Crowdfunding practices in general, and especially among social movements. Spain constitutes a conspicuous case study to explore the Crowdfudning-Advocatory movement nexus given the strong social-economic effects of the economic crisis and the quick and efficient reaction on the part of civil society movements."

Confidential interactions take place over insecure channels like e-mail and post. This situation poses risks and costs for service providers, civilians and governments, while goals regarding confidentiality and privacy are not always met. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate an alternative architecture in which identifying persons, exchanging information, authorizing external parties and signing documents will become more user-friendly and secure. As a starting point, each person has their personal data space, provided by a qualified trust service provider that also issues a high level of assurance electronic ID. Three main building blocks are required: (1) secure exchange between the personal data space of each person, (2) coordination functionalities provided by a token based infrastructure, and (3) governance over this infrastructure. Following the design science research approach, we developed prototypes of the building blocks that we will pilot in practice. Policy makers and practitioners that want to enable Willeke to get rid of her paperwork can find guidance throughout this paper and are welcome to join the pilots in the Netherlands."

Electronic Government, or E-Government, is widely regarded as a disruptor of traditional e-government service provision through greater citizen access, enhanced democracy, improved information quality, and a range of governmental efficiencies. Local government has been a key e-government focus for many nations due to the wide and varied interactions these governmental agencies have with citizens. A gap in the literature exists that monitors the development of local e-government, especially from the policy maker perspective, of This study presents the findings of a longitudinal study exploring the development of local e-government in New Zealand – from the policy makers’ perspective. All local and regional authorities in New Zealand were surveyed in 2000, 2004, and 2012 with the goal of understanding the key considerations associated with the development of e-government strategies and subsequent implementation of associated infrastructure. While local e-government development has been more incremental than transformational, there has been a trend towards greater consideration of citizen-focused issues including the likes of Consumer Confidence, Trust, Accessibility, The Digital Divide, Indigenous Peoples, Security, and Privacy. This offers a degree of reassurance that local authorities remain, and are indeed increasingly, focused on the provision of enhanced services to the communities they serve."

Overview of the governmental ICT initiatives shows that the key focus is the development of telecommunication infrastructure, widespread introduction of information technology to government in order to collect and process data and information security which are regarded as a step of transition to information society. Electronic Belarus is oriented generally to organizational and technological upgrading of the public administrations.

Given the high number of services requiring appointment scheduling across government, a government-wide approach which provides e-appointment service as part of a software infrastructure for e-Government is clearly appealing over agency-specific solutions. The paper presents a case study of a one-stop e-Appointment service proposed as part of software infrastructure for e-Government. Relying on appointment-related information maintained by individual agencies, the service enables applicants to seamlessly arrange appointments to visit government agencies or centers providing public services through the one-stop government portal. We define a generic business process underpinning the delivery of one-stop e-Appointment service, propose an approach for implementing each of the business process steps, and present a concrete software solution to support the process. In addition, the paper discusses how the proposed solution addresses some of the challenges identified for delivering the service as part of software infrastructure for e-Government."

Existing tabletop exercises are used to train, test and exercise emergency managers but do table top exercises mirror the wickedness? A pilot study where emergency managers were interviewed about the use of tabletop exercises has been carried out. The pilot study and traditional tabletop exercises are analyzed through the lens of wicked problems. The result shows that tabletop exercises partly mirrors wicked problems but cannot handle every aspect of wicked problems. The main reasons for this are, that the planning of tabletop exercises in which the problems and solutions are known beforehand tames the problems and that focusing on the use of plans entails leaving unplanned problems unaddressed. I propose three design ideas to be used when designing tabletop exercises to better prepare emergency managers for wicked problems. First, focus on unsolved (wicked) problems instead of on problems already handled in plans and allow participants to identify them. Second, let participants tame the problems during the exercise instead of taming the problems ahead of time planning the exercises. Third, use existing plans and lessons learned from previous emergencies, and resolve the problems in collaboration."

Yet little is known of the effects of social media on local politics. In this paper the Social Media Participation Model (SMPM) is introduced for studying the effects of social media on local political communities. The SMPM aims to explore the relationship between Social Media Participation and Community Participation. The model comprises four constructs: Social Media Choice, Social Media Use, Sense of Community and Community Engagement. The design of the case study was based on the SMPM and took place among the members and parties of the Enschede council, from a large municipality in the Netherlands. Social media participation levels were measured and compared with the Social Media Indicator (SMI). A negative correlation between Social Media Use and Sense of Community has been discovered. However, we could not find a causal effect that explains this correlation. To analyze the effects in more detail, we show directions for further improvement of the model."

The potential benefits of smart work involve the improvement of efficiency and achievement of balance between work and life. The purposes of this study are (1) to examine the specific characteristics of the smart work users and the level of their intention to use of smart work and (2) to analyze the 'driver' and 'constraint' factors that influence on intention to use and actual use behavior of smart work in Korea. To fulfill these purposes, the authors describe the characteristics of smart work users and analyze the causal relationship among various kinds of driver and constraint factors, the intention to use, and the use behavior of smart work with the first nation-wide survey data on smart work in Korea. Major findings of this research are as follows. First, the level of the diffusion of smart work seems to be low in terms of the number of the users of smart work. However, younger workers who have lower rank and shorter job tenure, and workers in quasi-governmental organizations show relatively high level of the intention to use of smart work as well as actually use it more frequently than other employee groups. Second, the perceived cost of commuting and travelling, the expected benefits of using smart work, and the institutional and technological supports have positive effect on smart work adoption of public employees. In contrast, the expected disadvantage of using smart work and organizational culture and management unfriendly to smart work have a negative effect on the use of smart work. Moreover, the authors find that the intention to use of smart work has mediation effect in the relationship between the drivers/constraints and the use behavior of smart work. Based on these results, theoretical and policy implications for the promotion of smart work are presented."

Within that context, an ongoing doctorate programme investigates the risk classification of eGovernment services and explores how a multi-perspective risk assessment framework may assist towards the management of such projects. This article presents the prototype version of the framework. Additionally, this paper describes an initial field investigation that was necessary to validate the prototype framework, a discussion on risk in eGovernment, as well as the risk taxonomy that is used to support the prototype."

However, adoption has only been investigated in the private sector. In this paper we examine the feasibility of continuous auditing and continuous monitoring in the public sector, specifically for municipalities in the Netherlands. A multiple case study is conducted about the opportunities and needs of continuously monitoring and assessing financial data concerning the social domain: care-related and social services, which have recently been decentralized from the national government to the municipal level. Interviews were held with representatives of six municipalities, administrative bodies, and an accounting firm. The research indicates that continuous monitoring is feasible, and that there is a need for continuous monitoring in the public domain. The ease of adoption depends to a large extent on the choice of whether and how a municipality wants to collaborate in offering social domain services."

These are a set of interrelated and sequential activities shared and executed by two or more Public Administration officies to achieve a business objective that is of value to citizens or companies in term of services. A Business Process results from the un-trivial integration of internal administration processes, so that structural problems such as livelock or deadlock may easily occur and in reality they are generally solved by involved civil servants. Nevertheless with the shift versus an electronic government this problem becomes particularly relevant. The paper presents a suitable approach for inter-organizational Business Process detection of livelock and deadlock situations. In particular, we introduce an approach to directly verify a Business Process modeled using the BPMN 2.0 semi-formal notation. The verification uses a state evaluation technique with an optimized unfolding algorithm considering specific BPMN 2.0 characteristics. A plug-in for the Eclipse platform has been also developed, which permits to have an integrated environment in which to design Business Process, using the Eclipse BPMN 2.0 Modeler, and to automatically verify it. The approach and the tool prototype have been successfully applied to real scenarios such as family reunion, grant citizenship and buoncer registration."

We propose a model taking the smart grid cost as primary decision variable to identify the optimal first time to adopt smart grid. We conclude that unless government provide sufficient financial support, certain projects would not be economically feasible. The study illustrated the use of ROA an important tool for simulate the impact of public policy on the adoption of the smart grid technology, and provided policy recommendations."

Even using decision support and intelligent data, tools are often inhibited by specialized and even proprietary goals in the sense that overall efficient collaborations are not yet possible - or the positive impacts are lessened across all resilience applications. Before proceeding with new developments, an analysis of existing applications was necessary for tools having a certain evaluation criteria cross-section of decision support, collaboration potential, and usability factors for users of all knowledge levels. To our best knowledge, a usability study of such tools is currently missing. Thus, this paper presents an analysis of existing risk assessment and disaster response tools to enable user communities to select the appropriate tools for their respective environmental response goals."

In the last two decades scholars have gradually refined the conceptualization of digital divide, moving from a dichotomous model mainly based on access to a multidimensional model accounting for differences in usage levels and perspectives. While models became more complex, research continued to mainly focus on deepening the understanding of demographic and socioeconomic differences between adopters and non-adopters. In doing so, the process of basic IT skills acquisition has been largely overlooked. This paper presents a metaphorical interpretation of the process of IT skills acquisition derived from empirical evidence. The analysis highlights the presence of three distinct IT skills acquisition approaches, as well as the key role of self-learning.

In this direction they have started moving from simpler forms of expoitation of these strong bi-directional communication channels to more complex and sophisticated ones. These attempts constitute important innovations for government agencies, so it is necessary to analyse them from this perspective as well. This paper analyzes an advanced form of centralised use of multiple social media by government agencies from this perspective, using the well established Diffusion of Innovation Theory of Rogers. It is based on a pilot application of the above approach for conducting a consultation campaign concerning the large scale application of a telemedicine program of the Piedmont Regional Government, Italy. It has been concluded that this approach has the fundamental preconditions for a wide diffusion (relative advantage, compatibility with existing values and processes, reasonable complexity, trialability and observability), at least in government organizations having a tradition of bi-directional communication with citizens in all phases of policy making, and also some experience in using social media for this purpose."

However, benefits management practices and effects of such practices are poorly documented. This paper presents a particular approach to benefits management that has been developed by the Norwegian government. The technique has been applied in 48 e-Government projects and this paper presents insights from the application of the technique and discusses its' strengths and weaknesses."

This study addresses this practice-research gap by reporting a study of a project involving 30 Norwegian government agencies using a common BM approach.A questionnaire was answered by project managers. Results show that that some 80 % of the managers considered their early quantifications of expected benefits to be realistic. Further, the managers found the approach useful. They felt projects became more focused, and expect to continue working with a BM approach. While the benefits that were identified and quantified in the reported projects represent estimates and not measurements, this study shows that BM can be useful – and even welcomed – in eGovernment projects and that demonstrating benefits from such projects can be accomplished."

Several authors argue that e-Government involves particularly complex settings, consisting of a variety of stakeholders promoting different and often conflicting objectives. Yet, few studies have explicitly addressed the inherent challenges of this complexity. This study focuses on the extent to which contradictory stakeholder objectives can help explain the relatively slow progress of G2G initiatives, and reports evidence from a G2G effort in Norway. A cluster of 5 local governments decided to explore the potential of ICT collaboration as leverage for their e-Government efforts. A neighboring cluster of 6 additional local governments were invited to join the project. During the course of the project, a number of challenges arose and the project objectives were only partially realized. The case is analyzed using stakeholder theory (ST) combined with dialectical analysis. This analysis model proved promising as a means of enhancing our understanding of conflicts in complex environments and even more important, why some stakeholders manage to achieve their objectives at the expense of other groups."

Yet, there has been little theoretical progress and a cumulative tradition is not emerging. We argue that a principle reason for this is a lack of shared understanding about basic concepts and entities amongst scholars in the field. Specifically, the entities that form the bedrock of e-Government research, such as “Government” and “Citizen” are conceptualized at a very general level of abstractions and treated as homogenous groups. We argue that existing models and frameworks fail to see the vast differences that exist between categories of these entities. Without a finer grained conceptualization, comparison of findings across different research studies is not possible and thus transfer of knowledge between different projects is difficult. This is a fundamental obstacle in developing a cumulative tradition. Based on an examination of the literature, we propose categories of “Government” and “Citizen” at a finer grain and discuss implications for both practice and research that stems from our conceptualization."

While early discussions were very conceptual, interoperability is increasingly seen as one of the key enablers of the promised benefits from eGovernment. Consequently, and not surprisingly, a considerable amount of research has been published related to interoperability. However, a conceptual model of the interoperability domain is currently missing. We thus propose such a model based on an extensive review of a subset of the eGovernment literature published in highly ranked information systems, public administration and eGovernment journals. The model outlines and discusses actors, activities, contextual factors, effects and evaluation related to interoperability. The resulting framework can be used as a common reference to assist in the development of cumulative research related to interoperability."

Although research on benefits realization provides some guidance to these issues, there is a lack of empirical research to validate central tenets in the literature and to provide the level of detail necessary to understand the impact benefits realization practices can have on organizations. To address these issues, we carried out an in-depth longitudinal case study of a large-scale benefits realization effort in Norway. Institutional theory was used to analyze the organizational impact. Our findings show that the work with benefits realization has had considerable organizational impact that is seen as positive for the realization of benefits. However, important issues such as stakeholder engagement and governance still need to be further addressed. Our study provides new insights concerning benefits realization processes in government and a theoretical perspective that can be further developed."

On the other hand, it imposes a higher challenge on a web designer to avoid digital exclusion. Before proposing guidelines to design e-gov sites, it is important to have objective methods to evaluate their quality. Traditional inspection methods do not cover the specificities of e-gov sites. This work proposes an extension of Nielsen’s heuristic evaluating method, applied to the information, services and citizens’ participation categories. Broad accessibility, interoperability, security and privacy, information truth and precision, service agility, and transparency are added. The g-Quality method was instrumental as an objective evaluation form. It was applied to 127 Brazilian e-gov sites. The extended method found more problems, resulting in more negative ratings than the Nielsen’s original method. The Brazilian public sites quality level was determined by using the g-Quality method, producing positive results."

When talking about contextual variables, researchers often categorize them as social, political, and economic. Regarding social conditions, the digital divide is probably the most studied concept, although the conceptualization can vary for authors from different disciplines and theoretical traditions. For instance, many authors use the digital divide to not only refer to access to the Internet and related technologies, but also the skills and capabilities of users and how they use technologies to generate value in their daily lives. This case study argues, however, that the social context goes well beyond the digital divide and includes additional important factors like extreme poverty and legal vulnerability. Using the case of immigration services in the southern border of Mexico, this paper shows how multiple variables from the social environment affect digital government success and its impact on multiple users."

Using a case study of food traceability from local farms to institutions, this paper contributes to this emerging field by identifying challenges and incentives in data sharing among different types of organizations. In particular, our goal is to study how small farms and institutional buyers can be incentivized to share their data in a way that contributes to food safety, public health, and other societal goals. Our findings demonstrate that initiatives which can show the benefits of having a whole-chain food traceability system, have clear policies and regulations, and opportunities for participation in training activities are key incentives."

Through the cooperation of different public and private actors, citizens (Public-Private-People Partnership - 4P) and the use of ICTs such as the Idea Management Systems and Gamification techniques, our methodological approach aims to analyze a service value network, model the key processes, identify structural holes and turn them into new public-private business opportunities.

The argument is that these individuals are differently positioned in relation to and have different prerequisites to participate in demands driven development processes, and that this has to be taken into account by practitioners who are working demands driven development of public sector. The aim of the paper is thus to address the need to acknowledge differences in individual users' possibilities to participate in the development of public sector through opening up and critically analyze categories indicating participants – e.g. ""users"", ""citizens"" or ""practitioners"". This is done through a discourse theoretical analysis of a text; the Swedish Guidelines for Demands Driven Development. The analysis of the text shows that the dominant category signifying a participatory subject is ""target group(s)"", which is articulated according to four different themes. However, none of these themes articulates an unpacking of the category ""target group(s)"", and the term is instead used to signify everyone as if these were alike and had the same prerequisites and possibilities to participate in demands driven development processes – in discourse theoretical terms ""target group(s) works as an empty signifier. In this way differences between the individuals who are included in the category are hidden, and practitioners are left with no guidelines for how to deal with these."

An empirical test of a multi-dimensional digital divide",NA,"10.1007/11823100_13","Scholars from different disciplines have recently studied a phenomenon called ""the digital divide"". Since many of the new government information technology initiatives are based on Internet technologies and require the use of the Internet by citizens, understanding the digital divide (and consequently, the potential demand) is important for e-government scholars. For some researchers, the divide is not a problem and Internet access is the only relevant determinant of Internet use (access divide). For other researchers, the divide is rooted in more fundamental social differences and opportunities (multi-dimensional divide). Using data from the Piedmont region in Italy, this paper tests these two competing views of the digital divide. Overall, the models based on a multi-dimensional view have greater explanatory power and provide evidence about the relevance of multiple factors affecting both Internet access and Internet use. For instance, females use the Internet for a smaller number of activities than males. Individuals with more formal education and who can speak English use the Internet more. Finally, individuals with more experience using a PC and the Internet itself also use the Internet to perform a broader range of activities."

These two perspectives are present in digital government research and both of them have important limitations that affect our understanding of government information technology initiatives. We argue that a more integrative perspective is needed. Moreover, some terms already available in the literature such as ensemble view, structuration, technology enactment, or socio-technical perspective could serve as starting points in this conversation. However, we also argue that a more integrative approach might not be enough and the development of new theoretical lenses based on concepts and variables from different disciplines should be a necessary next step in this process."

However, building such open systems remains a challenge: on the one hand, the systems are required to be open, whereas, on the other, there is the need to preserve and protect private and confidential information of potentially millions of users. This requires that e-governance systems carry clear specifications of how access to users' documents is managed throughout an e-governance application's workflow. We describe a modular, fine-grained, state-based model that can form the basis for specifying access control in e-governance service delivery workflows. The model consists of three layers: a data store, a workflow layer, and an access control layer connecting the two. The data store consists of fields and forms. The workflow is specified as concurrent processes each representing either a citizen or a government actor. The access control layer specifies, for each user (process), a view of the data store as determined by that user's state in the workflow. Such modular specifications can guide the implementation and the verification of e-governance applications. We illustrate our model with two representative examples from the e-governance domain and a web-based prototype implementation of one of them."

Distinguishing actual malicious activities from unusual but justifiable activities requires not only a sophisticated anomaly detection system but also the expertise of human analysts with access to additional data sources. Because any anomaly detection system for extremely rare events will generate many false positives, human analysts must decide which anomalies are worth their time and effort for follow-up investigations. Providing a ranked or scored list of users – the typical output of an anomaly detection system – is necessary but far from sufficient for this purpose. Anomalies indicative of insider threats can be distinguished from those that arise from legitimate activity by explaining why they are anomalous, and high-risk users may be identified by their repeated appearance near the top of the ranked and scored lists. This paper describes results of experiments that show the utility of these techniques of explaining and aggregating anomalies to detect insider threats with greater accuracy than is achieved solely with anomaly detection methods."

The study is particularly focused on analyzing and identifying differences on how northern and southern countries of Europe have adopted, accepted and promoted open government data portals. Using web content analysis, open government data portals of six countries, three from the Northern Europe region (Denmark, Norway, and United Kingdom) and three from the Southern European region (Italy, Portugal, and Spain) are scrutinized for understanding the status of open government data initiatives. The results of the direct content analysis observation point to the existence of some currently differences among the countries of the two regions, mainly in what concerns their ability to reuse open data made available by public entities. Some possible reasons for that are advanced and further streams of research to deep the understanding of those reasons are proposed. This way this paper offers new understanding of the current open government data efforts development."

Offering one-stop services presents many operational implications; an one-stop service provision (OSP) architecture is needed that, by means of a layered approach, provides facilities to refer to, invoke and combine e-Government services in a uniform way, in the context of cross-organisational workflows. Although enabling technologies for all the layers of such an architecture are quickly evolving (XML, WSDL, UDDI, WFMS et al) two major issues that need to be solved are (a) abstracting the heterogeneity of the e-Government services that need to be integrated and (b) identifying an appropriate style for cross-organisational workflow control, somewhere in between the fully centralised and peer-to-peer extremes. This paper presents an abstract layered OSP architecture, identifies some major enabling technologies and briefly discusses those two issues."

These efforts have been initiated mainly by non governmental organizations drawn from India’s urban, English-speaking, upper and middle classes. These efforts have been focused on non-partisan process improvements or short-lived political mobilization with limited success. We analyze these initiatives against the backdrop of modern India’s political evolution which has seen the marginalization of upper and middle classes in politics. We see technology as central to the re-engagement of ICT-savvy upper and middle classes with the political sphere. We suggest that political neutrality may be an effective and appropriate strategy for India’s upper and middle classes in the pursuit of their policy agendas."

This study moved beyond a formal notion by also investigating the use of expressives within The Guardian (UK) political discussion forum. A content analysis was employed as the primary instrument for examination. Additional textual analyses were conducted on the use of expressives. The findings suggest that with the exception of humour expressives tended to impede political talk rather than facilitating it."

So far, stakeholder models in the e-government context focus on individual stakeholder perspectives. They do not show or analyze interactions between stakeholders in detail. However, taking stakeholders’ interactions into account is important, since stakeholders influence each other - which can result in a change of their perspectives. Hence, our contribution illustrates how a stakeholder interaction model helps identifying different stakeholder perspectives. Therefore, we reviewed literature on existing stakeholder models. Besides, we conducted a stakeholder analysis in an e-government project in Germany and elicited stakeholders, assigned them to corresponding categories and modeled a stakeholder interaction model. Finally, we compared the findings of the literature review with the developed model. This contribution enlarges the theoretical foundations of the e-government research field. The stakeholder interaction model can be used by practitioners to identify stakeholders and their interactions."

The literature on various aspects of government tends to underestimate the role of IT while IT studies tend to overestimate it. IT and information systems are not much studied in political science. While some thirty years of studies of information systems have produced many theories concerning IT use in organisations, e-government studies require going beyond the border of the organization as government/nance cannot be reduced to individual organizations, not even if interorganisational cooperation is included. This paper proposes a model that considers governance as a system rather than in terms of its individual organizational units and processes, and views information systems from that perspective."

Papers were examined mainly for rigor, but to some extent also for relevance. It was found that theory generation and theory testing are not frequent while case stories (no theory, no structured data collection) and product descriptions (no analysis or test) are. Also, claims beyond what is reasonable given the method used are frequent. As for relevance, only a few of the cases where theories are either tested or generated concern the role and nature of government, most concern general organizational issues which could well find a place within traditional IS conferences. On the positive side, global outreach appears fairly good, as does involvement of various pertinent disciplines. It is concluded that eGov conferences need to address quality criteria, both rigor and relevance oriented ones, if the field shall develop to become a distinct research field."

It was assumed that a strict and open method would make the grounds for the decision clearer, and that people would accept a clearly motivated decision even though they personally preferred another solution. The project was also intended as a test of new methods for potential adoption into normal practices. The analysis shows mixed understanding of, and mixed belief in, the method. While generally happy with the project work, also this time the Council failed to make a decision as constituency concerns eventually overruled the rationality of the arguments in the decision making council. The case raises issues of both the potential for DSS in a political context and the nature of political decision making. In particular we conclude that DSS use has to be carefully crafted but swiftly executed, and more than a one-off effort as a change process is involved."

This argument is pursued by reviewing a decade of eGovernment development and research in terms of the guiding values as expressed by influential maturity models and relating them to the eGovernment domain, as defined by formal definitions and practice in combination. We find that development so far has overall been too narrowly guided by a technical focus and economic and administrative values and too little informed by public sector values. While there is no lack of broad frameworks there is scarcity as concerns structured research and evaluation models that encompass such values."

Hence indexes must not just measure features of web sites but also accurately indicate underlying government processes. eGovernment rankings are in a process of maturation in that direction, moving from purely measuring web sites to assessing use and government qualities. One such measurement is the UN eParticipation index, intended to measure how well governments connect to their citizens. This paper analyzes the quality of the index by validating it against other indexes of government-citizen relations qualities, democracy, internet filtering, and transparency. Results: The relation between the index and democracy and participation is non-existent. Countries which are authoritarian or obstruct citizen internet use by filtering can score high on eParticipation by window-dressing their webs. We suggest that the eParticipation index includes an element of reality check and propose ways to do that."

Both studies use the same method and makes comparison between the results. We find that however still focusing overwhelmingly on descriptions and little on theory testing and creation, paper quality appears much better in that references to literature have increased grossly, there are very few dubious claims, philosophical research and theoretical arguments are virtually extinct, and the number of case stories is vastly reduced. However, the number of product descriptions is more than doubled to just over 30 %. The reasons for this are discussed, and as most of these papers are based on EU research funding we propose that an important reason may be the funding mechanism where researchers are employed as helpers in product development rather than critical scrutiny and analysis."

Andersen [4]) and Shim & Eom [6] found such positive effects, but findings are not comparable as different indexes were used and index quality was not tested. To fill this gap this paper uses statistical methods to investigate if the positive effect of eGovernment is robust across different indexes. We find that while corruption is very consistently measured by the CCI and CPI indexes, eGovernment indexes vary widely as predictors. The Economist and ITU indexes are the best predictors. The UN index scores fairly good but none of the other tested indexes can serve as indicator. Findings indicate that including social and institutional analysis improves an index hugely while measuring web sites is pointless. This suggests that indexes would score similarly different also on other eGovernment effects, and that the choice of eGovernment index is very important."

Do requirements increase, decrease or change qualitatively? We compare manual and electronic versions of ten commonly used services. The needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures were considerably less for the e-services in eight out of ten cases; however, in complicated services there may rather be a change of skills, e.g. replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online. E-services relieve the user of some requirements; hence one obstacle for inclusion is reduced. However, we also found problems with the e-services implying that design of e-services should be informed by the kind of measure we have used as it is of great importance for inclusion in the e-society."

As a result, a growing number of people is in need of humanitarian support, for which limited resources are available. This requires an effective and efficient prioritization of the most vulnerable people in the preparedness phase, and the most affected people in the response phase of humanitarian action. Data-driven models have the potential to support this prioritization process. However, the applications of these models in a country requires a certain level of data preparedness. To achieve this level of data preparedness on a large scale we need to know how to facilitate, stimulate and coordinate data-sharing between humanitarian actors. We use a data ecosystem perspective to develop success criteria for establishing a ""humanitarian data ecosystem"". We first present the development of a general framework with data ecosystem governance success criteria based on a systematic literature review. Subsequently, the applicability of this framework in the humanitarian sector is assessed through a case study on the ""Community Risk Assessment and Prioritization toolbox"" developed by the Netherlands Red Cross. The empirical evidence led to the adaption the framework to the specific criteria that need to be addressed when aiming to establish a successful humanitarian data ecosystem."

The regression result shows that informativeness, named location, and several topics are significantly correlated with the log of the signature counts. These exploratory but promising results indicate that textual analysis tools can complement traditional statistical methods by providing descriptive measures that are helpful for making causal inferences from electronic petition data.

In an effort to address these issues, this article examines the use of Twitter by federal, state, and local government actors during the 2015--2016 Zika virus outbreak in the United States. We learned that local governments have smaller network sizes. Federal level agencies frequently use Twitter for information provision, using URLs and images while leveraging large network sizes. Elected office holders, in general, managed large networks, and leveraged their popularity during the crisis. This analysis will be of interest to both scholars and practitioners in the areas of emergency management, public administration, and political science, as it helps to deepen our understanding of how government agencies and political leaders engage with the public during times of crisis, and how social media usage differs across various levels of government."

This requires a detailed and robust population projection model, plus reliable and up-to-date data. The current paper describes a Danish approach to small-area population projections based on the well-known cohortcomponent principle supplied with some structural elements, and demonstrate how the results can be used to serve the decision making concerning school planning."

This paper, therefore, offers a conceptual framework for understanding and approaching the challenges and obstacles that arise in addressing the SPS threats of the IoT. This contribution aims to help policymakers in adopting policies and strategies that stimulate others to develop, deploy and use IoT devices, applications and services in secure, privacy-friendly and safe ways."

Given widespread recognition of the public value potential of these new uses of data, enterprise data management capability is increasingly salient and recognized as urgent. We further argue that creating capability for enterprise data management is poorly understood. However, since enterprise data management is a future practitioner imperative, new research from the digital government community addressing the challenges to creating such capability is required. We illustrate the salience and urgency of enterprise data management through three vignettes that highlight the potential of such efforts to reorganize the public sector along new data oriented lines. A focus on the role of governance and the chief data officer as key enablers to creating public value from data highlight the need for research in these areas."

We argue that the current US Administration's Open Government Initiative blurs traditional distinctions between e-democracy and e-government by incorporating historically democratic practices, now enabled by emerging technology, within administrative agencies. We consider how transparency, participation, and collaboration function as democratic practices in administrative agencies, suggesting that these processes are instrumental attributes of administrative action and decision making, rather than the objective of administrative action, as they appear to be currently treated. We propose alternatively that planning and assessing OG be addressed within a ""public value"" framework. The creation of public value is the goal of public organizations; through public value, public organizations meet the needs and wishes of the public with respect to substantive benefits as well as the intrinsic value of better government. We extend this view to OG by using the framework as a way to describe the value produced when interaction between government and citizens becomes more transparent, participative, and collaborative, i.e., more democratic."

An increasing requirement is for policy formulation is to become more adaptive and increasingly include design as part of vision and strategy setting. This is particularly important in the emerging complex environments where changing values need quick response. Thus as community values evolve ways to satisfy them are continually identified to ensure that change can be easily accommodated. The focus is on developing policy in solution neutral but meaningful terms while providing ways to respond quickly to policy changes through evolving projects. This paper proposes business building blocks combined with design thinking as a way to support such flexibility. Building blocks are now increasingly accepted as a way to build businesses whereas design thinking is finding increasing importance as a design approach that emphasizes innovation. It requires visualizations to help designers and policy makers to make sense of the complex relationships that exist in complex environments. The paper proposes a set of building blocks for policy formulation and illustrates how they can be organized for policy formulation."

Several of these perspectives seem to have the concept of co-production in common, implying that the public sector engages citizens to take part in the design and execution of services. A rather new way to achieve co-production in the public sector has been to utilize crowdsourcing or social media monitoring. However, the way these 'methods' has been implemented in public sector is often associated with difficulties, and to overcome some of them we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) approach that hopefully will create improved conditions for data-driven business development, and innovative citizen sourcing. At present, the approach is tested in a local government in northern Sweden in which we have set up a Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRa) designed for wireless battery-operated sensors. Although the test is still in an initial stage, results so far are promising and combining IoT and social media may be one way of creating co-production of public sector services."

Assessments are, among other things, important to justify e-government investments. They are challenging because they are complex, often based on locally defined indicators, many times over-emphasizing financial effects, imprecise, faced with a number of contingencies and very seldom validated. Consequently, effect assessments can be seen as imprecise and difficult to compare across different initiatives. This paper addresses some of the challenges by attempting to assess effects based on a public value framework through an action design study with a Norwegian government agency. Based on our findings, we suggest 5 design principles for adapting and using performance indicators for assessing effects from eGovernment initiatives."

Many values must be safeguarded and they are therefore legally protected. Interoperability can, however, create value conflicts and there is little empirical research into the constructive attempts to resolve such deep-rooted conflicts. This paper addresses this gap by an in-depth study of how values are institutionalized in laws and government organizations. Data was collected by means of participant observation and narrative interviews. The study showed that value conflicts constitute barriers to integration that were difficult to resolve. One major problem was that the necessary discussion about how the conflicts should be handled could not be held because there was no such arena. Different authorities were governed by different values that were deeply institutionalized; while services were to be integrated, the legal regulating bodies were not."

Such networks essentially rely on electronic information sharing across organisations, and thus rest on interoperability (IOP). However, whilst previous research has argued that expected impacts from IOP standard are a central factor for organisations' motivation to adopt them, not much research has been done on the actual impacts from adopting IOP standards for organisations. This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the impacts from the adoption of IOP standards on partner organisations in Government Information Networks. To this end, it combines a literature study with data from stakeholder interviews from two cases in the Netherlands in order to i) identify the relevant main impact categories and dimensions; ii) assess their relative relevance to stakeholders; and iii) draw recommendations for IOP governance from this analysis. The study thus fills a relevant gap in existing research on IOP, and contributes a guiding framework with key dimensions that practitioners can use for assessing the impacts and feasibility of IOP standards adoption."

In our analysis, we attempt to discuss the practical value from the syntegration workshop by reflecting on the power of regulation when we move from a national to an international context which is the arena for eCustoms regulation. Our conclusion is that although at a national level regulation can be a powerful instrument for eCustoms implementation, the power of regulation fades to recommendations and soft law the more we move to an international level, and thus, making it a less powerful instrument for eCustoms implementation."

Overall, we find that social media does not diminish the concentration of political voices within the democratic discourse. Rather, the evidence suggests that political voice is more concentrated when the voice is measured by the size of the online network using social media than when measured by traditional variables such as the number of lobbyists. We also report that a very small number of large organizations that have very large-sized online networks as measured by Twitter followers are driving the high concentration of online political voices."

The methodology addresses: 1) the level of government activity in different countries and sectors; 2) the topics that are addressed through such activities; 3) the resources shared between government and citizens as part of interactions; 4) the intensity of citizen response to government announcements; 5) the sentiment expressed by citizens when providing such responses; and 6) the combinations of such issues. Example combinations include identifying topics that generated the largest Twitter activity by government but received the least interest from citizens, identifying topics that generated the most polarized reactions from citizens, or determining correlation between policy announcements and trust, fear and other negative emotions expressed by citizens. The methodology uses visual analytics to reveal patterns and trends associated with various questions, complemented with sentiment analysis to study government-citizen interactions on Twitter. The methodology is validated by examining Twitter presence in five sectors --- health, social development, education, environment and work, in five Latin American countries with mature e-Participation capabilities --- Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay."

It examines an information system which, once implemented, was institutionalized, expanded and integrated into a network of independent systems and services which originated an information infrastructure. It describes how powerful or empowered agents contributed to develop the analyzed, information infrastructure and put into practice the first attempt to introduce e-gov, in the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo. Its implementation was initially based on the government discourse on transparency and control of public finances. However, knowledgeable actors used it to change the role they played in their institutions. Power is examined using the circuits of power framework adapted by Silva and Backhouse [1] for the information systems area. Hanseth´s infrastructure theory is adopted to study development of the information infrastructure and is complemented by disclosing the role played by power in the development of this information infrastructure."

Extant literature studied important aspects related to CIOs, such as competencies, roles, and relationship with CEO, yet it is fragmented and insufficiently comprehensive to offer an effective pathway or model to guide the transition to the CIO role. Studies on how public organizations in developing countries can create a transition to accommodate CIOs in their existing structures are necessary. This research, based on secondary data, identifies key issues that delineate the transition to CIO role anchored in institutional theory and the context of developing countries, including perceived organizational readiness, human capacity, strategic orientation, and organizational culture. Their interrelationships with proper institutional interventions and adaptation to contextual characteristics establish the foundation for a process map for the transition to the CIO role."

Key aims include achieving more organizational agility, and to tidy up a messy portfolio of IT silo systems. A holistic approach to IT architecture has been an accepted strategy, but the results of these initiatives have been variable. An under-researched aspect is how different organizational units respond to the call for a holistic approach. In this study, we investigate how different stakeholders connected to three ongoing projects responded to the call for EA. With a qualitative approach, we identify three options of response to EA initiatives: (i) compliance with the EA strategy, (ii) loyal but isolated response, and (iii) rebel solutions. We argue for the need of a more nuanced repertoire of actions for dealing with EA, and show how these responses are useful for understanding and managing successful EA."

This is based on the argument that opening up government data has tremendous social, political and economic benefits. However, if data is open in a format that is not useful to data prospects, it is as good as data that is not open at all. Most governments around the world, especially in the developing countries, have concentrated their efforts around transparency in governance as a major reason for open data. They have only succeeded in opening and publishing data on government Web/open data Portals in unstructured formats. This has prevented innovative use and reuse of data by developers/entrepreneurs and the public for good governance, economic, environmental and social development. Also, access to quality and accurate data as well as how to address privacy issues are critical to achieving the promises of OGD. In addition, the institutional politics around data ownership among government agencies and their readiness to open actual data are critical to national OGD portal. This paper develops an integrated Open Government Data model & architecture based on literature reviews of secondary data to address issues around data format, quality, accuracy and ownership. While addressing these challenges, the goal of the architecture is to guide governments in building a sustainable OGD portal with linked data as the output and the highest level of open data format. The connection of related data makes data effectively reusable to create public value."

While administrative use is mainly motivated by citizens-administrators interaction, including politically elected, political use is highly visible during election times, not necessarily confined to these times. In this study we focus on a 3-month period twitter use by mayoral candidates in Turkey, particularly at metropolitan cities starting from the first of January till end of the March 30, 2014 when local elections were held. Tweets are categorized as of six types (i.e. information and news sharing, location and activity sharing, personal messages, direct interaction with citizens, better public services, support mobilization) derived from literature. We aim to show, at local scales, how and for which purposes twitter is used at local elections other than that of political campaign. Our results reveal that candidates for metropolitan mayors use twitter for mainly location and activity sharing during elections times as expected. What is unexpected for the study results are tweets sent for better public services as the second most tweeted category."

It is the result of an initiative of the Chilean government to reinforce its e-government strategy. The proposed model, called eGov-MM (e-Government Maturity Model), has three dimensions (a cube) supporting business processes: information criteria, IT resources, and leverage domains. Changing the traditional and exclusive focus on IT, four Leverage Domains are defined: e-Strategy, IT Governance, Process Management, and People and Organization Capabilities. The Leverage Domains generate a hierarchical structure with a second level named Key Domain Areas. These areas should be measurable and controllable, so they are related to a third hierarchical level, called Critical Variables, allowing the model’s elements to be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The capability and maturity of these variables associated with the intersection with the other two axes of the cube establish five levels of capability. The proposed model is strongly supported by the international experience and best practices for IT management and has already been field tested."

However, existing design approaches for m-government services and other mobile applications fail to address these aspects comprehensively. To bridge this gap, we present a framework for designing m-government services. Design science research was used to develop the framework: Literature review was employed to build the knowledge from scientific literature. A survey was used to collect experiences from practitioners such as designers and developers of m-government services from developing countries. Findings from the review and empirical work derived requirements for the framework and identified a set of components that support the design of m-government services in developing countries. The components comprise a method, viewpoints and a metamodel, principles, and guidelines, stakeholder management, and a repository. The framework can be applied in government organizations when designing mobile public services."

However, the academic discourse on these issues suffers from the lack of clarity and precise understanding of the ICT artefact. We have therefor developed an analytical framework by conceptualizing ICTs along three dimensions; how it is viewed, its use and how it impacts development.

This reform process was initiated out of the need to provide politicians with information for control and regulatory purposes, and the reform resulted in a centralised management information system. This system, however, has evolved into a coordinated but also partly locally delegated decision-making instrument which processes most of the applications for admission to higher education in Norway. Our analysis aims at identifying the driving forces and mechanisms that have motivated this long-term and complex development process. We ask to what extent we may claim that management interests have been the key factor in these reform processes? Or, has the development been impelled instead by advances in new information and communication technologies? Our conclusion is that neither of these hypotheses can fully explain these processes. It is indisputable that political and central management priorities have been crucially important in this reform. At the same time, we cannot neglect the dynamics related to the visions that technological developments have created. Such visions, implemented through collaborative processes and including a central project team and support staff in the various local institutions, seem to have created an environment for innovative technical and administrative solutions."

After Obama’s successful presidential campaign in 2008, expectations about the use of SNS in the Norwegian parliamentary election were high. This study explores genres of participation in the early stages of the 2009 Norwegian parliamentary election campaign. The main finding is that the political parties have seen the need for a presence in SNS’, and that a genre repertoire for political communication through SNS is beginning to evolve. However, there is little agreement between citizens and politicians about how the different genres should be enacted. Further work with genres is presented as a possible solution to lessening this communication gap."

In 2009 all the parties represented in parliament experimented with social media, and in 2013 social media had become an important and integrated part of the parliamentary election campaign. This paper is a continuation of studies conducted in 2009 and 2013 on the communication genres used by political parties and voters during the campaign. In 2009, a genre system for political communication was emerging. In 2013 the genre system was more established and professionalised. This paper presents findings from the latest election in 2017, where there was concerns that the polarizing effects of Brexit, right-wing populism and the Trump campaign would influence online political communication during the campaign. The findings indicate that polarization is indeed part of the picture, but mostly when we view social media in isolation. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for democracy and the public sphere."

This process consists in observing documents containing data concerning the organizational environment, the duties required by the position, the course program carried out by the employee, and whether they have direct or indirect correlation. Currently, this correlation evaluation is performed subjectively and there are no instruments that can indicate the degree of similarity between the information. We use text mining techniques to automatically identify correlation through textual representation approaches and syntactic and semantic modeling, which retrieve terms and dimension their respective meanings. To obtain the degree of similarity between the respective documents, the measure of the cosines similarity was used. The results showed that the documents evaluated as correlated by the domain expert presented a degree of similarity consistent with the automatic evaluation. For the uncorrelated cases, it was perceived that the degree of high similarity was influenced by the comprehensiveness of the organizational environment common to all documents. After investigation and identification of the appropriate environment specification, the grades obtained represented the evaluation correctly. The proposed approach contributes to the speed of process judgment, as well as to promote formulations of criticism about the content of political qualifications. In addition, it enhanced processes and information transparency by tracking and publicizing all steps. Lastly, we present a simulation for a course recommendation task, considering position profiles and organizational environment."

Process bundles are created whenever cross-organizational processes are combined or interlinked. While a considerable amount of literature addressing the process of reorganizing, optimizing, or reengineering processes exists, much less is known about concrete approaches which facilitate the identification of suitable process bundles. This paper presents a review of identification criteria relevant for process bundling. Our literature review is deliberately broad, encompassing work in the fields of process management, reengineering, and E-Government. The analysis discloses that the plain focus on secondary process identification criteria (e.g., inefficiencies and redundancies) neglects to assess if the processes actually fit together. Premised on these results, we synthesize the insights from the cited literature into a methodological intermediary step to support the purposeful elicitation of bundling candidates."

Recently, Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives emerged worldwide aiming to make public data freely available to everyone, without limiting restrictions. Despite its potential however there is currently a lack of roadmaps, guidelines and benchmarking frameworks to drive and measure OGD progress. This is particularly true as proposed stage models for measuring eGovernment progress focus on services and do not sufficiently consider data. In this paper, we capitalize on literature on eGovernment stage models and OGD initiatives to propose a stage model for OGD. The proposed model has two main dimensions, namely organizational & technological complexity and added value for data consumers. We anticipate the proposed model will open up a scientific discussion on OGD stage models and will be used by practitioners for constructing roadmaps and for benchmarking just like the European Union stage model is currently used for measuring public service online sophistication."

The once-only principle (OOP) states that any standard information that one public administration has already collected should be shared with other public administrations, within or outside the country. The European-wide adoption of the once-only principle is seen as a promising way to relieve businesses from the burden of submitting the same data to different public administrations multiple times, as it would enable EU Member States to share and reuse the data that another state has already collected. However, the cross-border implementation of the OOP is hindered by a number of barriers and challenges. This paper presents the first results of an analysis of the barriers and drivers associated with the OOP, conducted as part of a large-scale European initiative involving 50 organizations in 21 countries. Our findings point to the prevalence of legal, interoperability and resource-related concerns among the perceived barriers. The study also shows the importance of political will, evidence of benefits, and demand from end users as drivers of OOP."

While prior research on the adoption of integration technologies in the private and public domain has considered several determinants (e.g. benefits, barriers, costs), little attention has been given to investigate the attitudinal and behavioural determinants influencing top management's decision making process for the adoption of integration technologies in LGAs. Notwithstanding, the implications of this research have yet to be assessed, leaving scope for timeliness and novel research.

To access the digital services in a smart city, a citywide high-speed broadband wireless network is required to provide connectivity to devices like smartphones, tablets, PCs, and wearables. The number of connected devices is increasing exponentially leading to a higher demand for the improved capacity of telecommunication infrastructure. The factors related with telecom connectivity are selected from various literature studies. To identify the interrelationships among the factors, the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) has been deployed. Further, MICMAC analysis determines the driving power and dependence among the factors. The study finds that the wireless coverage, mobile latency and access to electricity are key driving factors of telecommunication connectivity. Based on the study findings, supply and demand both side policies of telecommunication infrastructure have been recommended. The policy makers, stakeholders, and different service providers can get benefits from the recommended solutions in improving the telecommunication infrastructure in developing countries like India."

This void unprecedentedly grows when information and communication technologies (ICTs) are at stake. Though the presence of developments and studies are growing in recent years, there is still a continuing need to explore the notion of public values (PVs) in public administration in its possible extent. When taking ICTs as intermediary mechanisms, it is arguable that there is a void regarding the effects of public sector innovation through ICTs on PVs to be delivered. This paper addresses this vacuity by presenting a meta-analysis on this very subject by framing a particular positioning in the field through papers systematically defined according to some criteria. We found that ICT-related innovation can promote PVs mainly through transforming the relationship between government and citizens, improving democratic outcomes such as transparency and public participation, assisting in meeting collective expectations of the public, and enabling knowledge exchange and collaboration across different organizations."

In some cases Twitter substitutes traditional media if censorship is enlarged to such a level that the mainstream media channels prefer not to reflect the actual volume of the protests. Twitter is also utilized by politicians during such events to reinforce ""us vs. them"" division, and to gain support and legitimization for their own actions. Using critical discourse analysis, this paper aims to investigate the recurring speech patterns in the tweets of top-level politicians during the Gezi Park protests that started in Istanbul Turkey in June 2013 and spread the country rapidly. We study the tweets to draw conclusions on whether the politicians' statements represent marginalization and polarization efforts during the Gezi Park protests. In this paper, we consider social uprising as a communal expression of both political and apolitical opposition to the party in power. Our analysis reveals that the politicians' tweets are mainly characterized by a discourse that guides the public into some conscious direction that may reproduce marginalization and polarization among the public at large."

The purpose of the platform is to increase government transparency in state legislatures. It allows citizens to follow state lawmakers, lobbyists, and advocates as they debate, craft, and vote on policy proposals. State hearings in the U.S. are typically recorded on video and broadcast on cable TV stations, but they are not transcribed or indexed. No official written records of these exist anywhere. Digital Democracy creates professional quality transcripts and provides them publicly in a searchable and video-synchronized format. In this paper, we focus on one of the main challenges in video transcription: identifying the speaker. While transcription provides searchable content of state hearings, people can only follow the dynamics of a debate if they know who said what and when during a hearing. Our speaker identification approach applies well-known voice recognition, deep-learning-based face recognition, and text understanding approaches to an ever growing pool of legislative hearing videos. All speaker recognition predictions from voice, face, and text are combined by a ranking scheme, and ultimately integrated back into the transcription process. We describe the current architecture, technologies, and multimodal fusion used for speaker identification within the Digital Democracy project. We show that our multimodal fusion approach increases ""top 5"" legislator identification accuracy to 80% in California and 58% in New York."

In conditions of uncertainty and imperfect information, such as during political crises or controversial elections in emerging democracies, reliable information is often difficult to obtain. We investigated the uses and gratifications obtained from diverse information sources available to citizens during the months leading up to Presidential elections in Mexico in July 2012. Uses and gratifications theory states that information seeking is one of several primary needs or motivations for using different media. Reliability of information sources is key to gratification of this need. We conducted a survey about diverse information sources and their reliability with an opportunity sample of young adults at a public state university in Mexico. Our findings indicate that face-to-face and telephone communication with members of a respondent's social network, as well as social media and online news sites, were the most reliable sources of information about the elections. Television broadcasting, especially from government channels, was the least reliable. These results suggest that in conditions of relative uncertainty and imperfect information, social media and alternative (online) news sources about political events are essential to sustaining an informed public."

By relying on literature on digital governance as well as on public sector governance and using various qualitative methods, this on-going research focuses on the public sector reforms and digital government efforts in Estonia. It reveals that the relationships between technology and public sector reforms have been broadly unintentional. Most importantly, policy communities pushing for advancement of digital government and public sector reforms are different and there is a considerable mismatch in policy-making. One hand, this divide stems from emphasis on different ideas. Some policy-makers are highly technology-centric while other assign primary role to institutions. On the other hand, considerable barriers for interagency cooperation exist as well as cooperation between public and private sector. The latter is particularly challenging as the bottom-up cooperation between private and public sector has been a particular strength in the development of digital governance in Estonia. Furthermore, relative de-centralization of online public sector services has been a source of innovation. At the same time, public sector governance has been highly centralized. These mismatches between digital governance and overall public sector governance has contributed to institutional complexity and lead to bottlenecks in advancing public sector governance and digitalization of governance."

Governments generally choose their suppliers based on the minimum price. However, other criteria than price may be considered to help governments choose the best suppliers. This paper proposes a formal reputation model that is intended to determine the winners of an e-procurement process. The proposed model combines three elements: (1) the direct reputation of the supplier, (2) the indirect reputation of the supplier, and (3) the difference in beliefs between the government and the supplier. Using a multi-agent approach, the proposed model compares between situations where reputation is integrated along price for selecting suppliers and when it is not.

Second, we are building a portal that serves as platform for users to discuss the security of websites. These sources can be linked together. This helps to strengthen the knowledge of government officials and citizens with regard to cybersecurity issues. These issues are a central concern for open government initiatives."

However, whereas there is literature on public-private collaboration, very little of it addresses how these collaborations can be shaped to make use of the huge potential that technological innovations in ICT may offer. To address this gap, this paper addresses public-private collaborative development of digital information infrastructures (IIs). Drawing on a combination of literature on public-private partnerships and on digital information systems or infrastructures, this paper studies an initiative for exchanging information among international trade supply chain partners and between the businesses and government (e.g. for declarations, compliance, border control). Specifically, it explores what would be the Dutch end of such an II, to understand the interplay between the technological innovation and partnerships that form the social context thereof."

This requires the coordination of dependencies among the various departments located in the frontend and backend of organizations, and might include interdependencies with external parties. Transforming this fragmented landscape requires an understanding of issues at play, and the collaborative development of possible solutions. Every stakeholder has its own perspective, background, knowledge, and interests, and with their own situation and issues in mind, they often fail to grasp the bigger picture. Simulation games refer to a situation in which human participants play a role and follow certain rules to simulate a complex real-world phenomenon. Such a game can enhance participant's understanding of the complexities involved in the big picture, which might facilitate improvement. In this paper we present and evaluate a simulation game for public service delivery. The game facilitates problem-oriented learning and collaborative improvement of public service delivery. We measured participant views on the success of the collaboration in multiple sessions, using observations and a survey. The analyses show that participants find the process of the game successful and are willing to commit resources to it."

Comparing the frameworks and guidelines provided by central European and U.S. governmental units, we find information integration and process integration as prominent concepts to guide interoperability efforts, but they seem to point to different directions. This paper aims at contrasting the different characteristics of both approaches and concludes with recommendations according to the intended organisational scope of integration. To be successful in these efforts it is important to understand that (a) interoperability requires a guiding vision of integration, (b) each type of integration points to a different set of interrelated ideas, assumptions and technical means, and (c) integration implies a strategic commitment to explicit forms of cross-organisational cooperation and their implementation."

However, little is known about what 'best practice' of IT governance could mean when applied to an inter-organizational and highly distributed information infrastructure as typical for the public sector. In this paper the case of Egypt is analyzed based on previous investigations and publications, governmental documents, and data collected from a recent project involvement. The main IT governance challenges have been found as: unclear definition of network membership, extensive voluntarism, vague goal orientation, unprotected data resources, absence of financial governance, and the project status of network. Accordingly, lessons to be learned include that (1) creators of a network hub must clarify goal direction, membership responsibilities, performance assessment for all government agencies involved, (2) participating government agencies need to understand, commit to, practice sharing of accountability beyond hierarchy or ownership, (3) countries with little collaboration culture and network experience are better off to rely on accepted dominating actors for managing inter-organizational collaboration hubs in e-government. Based on essential attributes of the required governance process milestones are suggested for improving inter-organizational IT governance while addressing the detected challenges in Egypt and beyond. In conclusion, more research is needed to discuss any fit of inter-organizational IT governance arrangements to a given e-government context. Building on IT governance research related to enterprises, future e-government research can stay aligned and continue to share the lessons learned."

However, this is not always the case: this paper focuses on Egypt implementing technology and systems based on service-oriented architecture, largely without the expected organizational readiness regarding the interoperability effort. Does this mean that the current initiative is bound to fail? Or is the Egyptian approach maybe an appropriate strategy for countries which do not want to repeat painful non-interoperability experiences of their developed peers? This case study research seeks to provide evidence to what extent the Egyptian experience indicates a model for e-government adopters how to best develop interoperability. The paper concludes that a technology-first approach indeed can be held accountable for waste of time and resources due to delays in inevitable collaborative organizational learning. But if the latter is impaired for other reasons then choosing and implementing the ""right"" technology upfront is likely to have a positive impact on streamlining the organizational discourse and on pursuing a consistent e-government interoperability strategy."

Basic approaches to service development are published, but there is a lack of sharing ""best practices"" how to implement this step by step in the area of e-government. In particular, it is unknown to what extent administrations are able to follow existing service development approaches and reach a successful outcome within a reasonable frame of time and resources, or what are the barriers to applying the state-of-the-art methodologies? The research approach is exploratory. The case of Egypt, where service-oriented architecture was chosen as the main interoperability approach, is investigated how services are currently being developed and what kind of methodological enhancements could be appropriate. The case analysis on practical and strategic level leads to proposing success factors of developing G2G services with respect to problem perception, action plan, commitment, and future options. These can be used as hypothesis in future research and also as guidelines for improving governance, staff development and change management in administrative practice."

Several of these instruments have been applied in the Access-eGov project and we discuss the experience gathered in view of the newly developed framework in order to identify lessons learnt as well as to point to future research. The contribution of the paper is a portfolio of test strategies suggesting certain instruments to be applied from a systems view, agent view, and user view.

Consequently Europe was not surprised that Germany in 1997 took over a pole position presenting the first law on digital signature, an important element for Electronic Government purposes. But it turned out that this early law meant only a pre-dawn. It turned out that Germany - as it is undoubtedly big - needed much time and energy to get itself in motion. The presumed ""giant"" evolved to be a specter of mostly isolated actions and projects. Since two years - beginning with a memorandum on Electronic Government triggered by the two major IT associations - there are more and more actors striving for joint action.

The following research propositions were investigated: i) egovernment users are motivated by generic benefits offered by the Web, such as convenience and information provision, rather than democratic engagement; ii) users and non-users perceive moderate value in using e-government for knowledge acquisition and communication, but little value as a vehicle for democratic dialogue, iii) frequent users are more positive than other groups. All three research propositions are supported, suggesting that it may be difficult to engage citizens online in participatory democracy. Employing the phrase of the London Underground, we suggest that there is a Gap between e-government and e-governance that must be ‘minded’ (paid attention to). Governments should not assume that the former will morph smoothly into the latter by political will alone."

A conceptual framework for the diffusion of e-government innovations in the public sector is developed which combines a functional and a constructivist (or cultural) approach of diffusion. The framework focuses on diffusion as a mutual process of communication, learning and sense making. Based on this framework and by using data from documentation, websites and interviews, the process of diffusion and adoption of SMS-alert is reconstructed and the factors and mechanisms explaining this process are identified. The case study demonstrates that although SMS-alert has diffused rather rapidly until now, the diffusion process is currently facing some difficulties, mainly due to the existence of competing innovations. By demonstrating the importance of both the functional, political and institutional meaning of the innovation, the article confirms the value of combining different approaches in studying the diffusion of e-government innovations."

These are found to be: (1) indistinct and subdivided responsibilities, (2) focus on the autonomy of the own organization, and (3) insufficient scale. Given these problems, and given their different importance in the four cases, it is argued that the effective development of integrated public service delivery in the Netherlands requires more centralization."

Many governments are adopting performance measurement as a part of reform efforts. Despite the widespread practitioner attention, academic studies are inconclusive about the impact of performance measurement in the public sector. Moreover, while studies have examined what factors influence the adoption of performance measures and its impact, they have paid relatively less attention to the use of different types of performance measures. To fill this gap, this study examines: (1) what types of performance measures are collected by US local governments and; (2) how organizational, technical, and external factors influence the collection of performance measurement. Leveraging survey data, we conduct cluster analysis and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to study factors that impact the collection of performance measures. The findings of QCA highlight that no single condition dominates the collection of performance measurement, rather different combinations of organizational and external factors influence the outcome. The paper concludes by discussing the implications for local policymakers and managers."

It has been claimed that public sector has a less satisfactory conduct of information system support than private sector. In earlier work we have tried to find support for such claims without getting significant results. Whereas these earlier investigations only had data from around 70 organizations, in this article we present selected data from an extended survey investigations performed among more than 250 Norwegian organizations on how they conduct information systems development and maintenance. This investigation has earlier been compared with similar investigations of this sort. A major finding from the previous comparisons is that even if we witness large changes in the underlying implementation technology and approaches used, a number of aspects such as the overall percentage of time used for maintaining and evolving systems in production compared to time used for development is remarkably stable. When we compare public and private organizations in the last survey on the other hand, we find statistically significant differences supporting the claims of better usage of resources for information systems evolution in private than in public sector."

Using deliberative democracy as a theoretical lens, this paper proposes a coding scheme for understanding the progress of citizens' deliberation through content analysis from a naturally occurring online discussion of a local planning project. By comparing patterns of this online discourse with normative views of deliberative dialogues, we found that important indicators of the deliberative ideal are missing. Our results show that citizens were not able to move towards advanced phases of deliberation as prescribed by deliberative democracy theory; and explain why it failed to develop common ground and joint assessment of alternative courses of action. We further explore possible causes of such patterns and identified a number of barriers that make online discussions less optimal to achieve common ground and collective judgment. Based on such findings, we suggest ways to improve deliberative outcomes by introducing active facilitation and advanced information support."

This paper explores the mechanisms of data generation and the determinants of data contexts in local governments. To do so, we conducted an in-depth case study of data collection and creation in a city government in New York State in the U.S., focusing on administrative data. We found that local government data are collected or created in three ways: original raw data collection, original raw data creation, and second or higher-order data creation. Both the internal and external environments of local governments add complexity to data management by influencing who, what, where, when and how to collect and create data for administrative purposes through these processes."

Despite increasing ""citizen participation"" in the discourse, there is very little debate on their socio-political implications. While some argue that ICT will enhance democratic debate and empower citizens [45, 18, 8], others concern about the development of Smart Cities ""without critical discussions and 'politics'"" [55, 5, 53] and notice the lack of attention for the politics of technical choices. This applies in particular to Smart Cities, since they require citizens to change behaviour according to quantitative targets and technological features. Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) launched its Smart City project in 2010. The government set specific criteria in order to ensure the ""participation of all the stakeholders"" (among which the citizens) and the ""lifestyle innovation"" [22]. The paper analyses information provided by semi-structured interviews to stakeholders of Japanese Smart Cities; the tools of citizen involvement proved effective in promoting cooperation and achieving significant outcomes in terms of energy consumption reductions, this involvement has not allowed any political debate about core issues such as Smart City, sustainability, and policies. METI and Japanese Smart Cities risk the potential for social innovation [7]. Research on behaviour change and sustainability also suggests that such situation is likely to hinder more significant shift towards sustainable lifestyles [56, 50]. Drawing on analysis of official documents as well as on interviews with each of the four Smart Communities' stakeholders, the paper explains that very little input is expected from Japanese citizens. Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of Smart Communities would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather to make them participate in the co-production of public services, mainly energy production and distribution."

Evidence from the 2007 Swiss Federal Elections",NA,"10.1007/978-3-642-15158-3_18","Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) render a valuable platform for tackling one of democracy’s central challenges: low voter turnout. Studies indicate that lack of information and cost-benefit considerations cause voters to abstain from voting. VAAs are online voting assistance tools which match own political preferences with those of candidates and parties in elections. By assisting voters in their decision-making process prior to casting their votes, VAAs not only rebut rational choice reasoning against voting but also narrow existing information gaps. In this paper we examine the impact of VAAs on participation and voter turnout. Specifically, we present results on how the Swiss VAA smartvote affected voter turnout in the 2007 federal elections. Our analyses suggest that smartvote does have a mobilizing capacity, especially among young voters who are usually underrepresented at polls. Moreover, the study demonstrates how VAAs such as smartvote do affect citizen’s propensity to deal with politics in general."

This subject is of special importance because as long as e-government services are not utilized by citizens, new investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) sector would lead to the wastage of assets and resources. Accepting of e-services by citizens assures efficiency and usefulness of those services. In Iran, e-government services are delivered to citizens via service offices named e-government service counters. This study was intended to investigate the factors affecting on acceptance of e-services of e-government counters in Mashhad, Iran. Our research method was based on applied, survey research. The data was collected from citizens who were using e-government service counters via a questionnaire. The construct validity was scrutinized through factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha coefficient > 0.7 for different constructs of the questionnaire, affirmed its reliability. Statistical analysis of data was performed by method of structural equation modeling. The results showed that, first of all, organizational and social factors had significant positive effects on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Additionally, the influences of perceived ease of use and usefulness on attitude towards utilizing these services and, ultimately, influence of this variable on behavioral intention were confirmed. Finally, we proposed some practical recommendations for future studies and enumerated research limitations."

Possibilities for interaction and citizen engagement have become multiple and diverse and have been used by all levels of government. This paper investigates the following research question: what are the determinants of the use of Facebook by Portuguese local governments to communicate with their citizens? Our main objective is to use both descriptive and explanatory analyses to not only investigate the determinants of the activity of local governments on Facebook but also to map the activity of those governments in this social media. We use a political market framework to develop hypotheses about the influence of mayoral leadership, local government capacity, and other political traits of the local governments themselves (""supply-side determinants"") and socio demographic, economic, and cultural factors (""demand-side"" determinants). We test the hypotheses derived from this theoretical framework using several metrics of the degree of Facebook activity and citizen engagement levels displayed by all 308 Portuguese municipalities in a three-month period at the end of the year 2016. Findings indicate that in larger and wealthier municipalities local executives are more likely to display increased reliance on Facebook. Facebook post activity is also positively associated with higher transparency levels and mayoral turnover."

In this paper, we demonstrate how a systematic service composition can be accomplished: with the help of the proposed Service Description Worksheet, the e-Government Services can now be classified, searched for and composed into larger groups. This goal-driven approach can be used to understand the needs of different organizations and to depict the various functional characteristics of the cooperative processes in a declarative manner, suitable for prototyping projects in the public sector.

CzRM promises higher service quality at lower costs. CzRM was originally a private sector business strategy, part of the “entrepreneurial” paradigm that was applied to the public sector in the mid-1990s. This paper deals with four concerns: the assertion that transformation of citizens into customers has damaging effects on democratic governance and public administration; the existence of digital divides; accountability-issues; and the role of consultants as intermediaries. Finally, the change in citizens’ wants and views about government may be caused by more fundamental changes happening in the American society. Despite the mentioned concerns, CzRM is feasible, but it should occur with an awareness of the raison d’être of the public sector, and that government has a role in securing both the quality and equality of government services."

The goal is twofold: capture the basic processes through which the ToC emerges and evolves; explore in an artificial society the effects of different strategies aiming to contrast the phenomenon. Our attention is focused on the interplay between different factors proven to be involved in the genesis of this dilemma: the selfish rationality of human beings, the temporal dimension of individual choices and the potential impact of sanctions."

However, in practice, residents have limited SCS acceptance, which deserves to be further investigated in the literature. This study investigates the SCS adoption of residents by integrating technological belief factors (perceived usefulness and enjoyment), and social influence factor (affective community commitment). A survey of 191 residents identifies perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and affective community commitment as important determinants of SCS adoption. Affective community commitment weakens the effect of perceived enjoyment yet strengthen the effect of perceived usefulness on SCS adoption. Our study fills the research gap on smart community as well as enriches the IT acceptance literature. This study also offers practical recommendations that can aid practitioners in conducting smart community programs."

From the citizens point of view, although the e-Government service brings citizens online service, citizens need to visit at least one of the governmental offices for receiving specific service such as job interview, ID card issuing, or attending social events. These kinds of service often accompany with payments for the service charge. It means that the citizen has to do three things: request for reservation, payment for the service, and visit at least one of the governmental offices. In this paper, the Online Internet Reservation of e-Government Service(ORGS), one of the smart card based models for online Internet reservation accompanying with payment, is proposed for its efficiency and security of these kinds of service. Java card security functions are part of the building components of the Java Card Applications Toolkit(J-CAT). The J-CAT is designed to provide developers with security, easiness and efficiency in developing Java card applications. In this paper, the proposed ORGS implemented by the J-CAT provides users, developers, and managers with security, easiness, and efficiency."

When news is produced through a process of selection and rephrase by reporters and media firms, reporters' personal political leaning and personal opinions may influence the process, important messages may inevitably loss. In Taiwan, the Parliamentary Library of Legislative Yuan website provides detailed contents about activities happening in the Legislative Yuan, including such contents as transcripts and video recordings of interpellation, conference speech, interim and legislation proposals. Although there is a complete record of information provided online, but the quantity of the legislative documents are far too much for citizens to make sense of. It is imperative that better organized information released to the public would facilitate readers to reduce the cognitive loads in understanding what issues have been discussed by legislators and reported by the media. To minimize the gap between legislative documents and the general public, this study proposes a text mining mechanism to automatically cluster legislative and news documents to identify media frames, and then represents the proportion of each frame corresponding to information sources. The automatic clustering system can determine media frames with the minimum amount of human interference. The results of interviews show that the information system proposed in this study is able to provide political domain experts hard evidences of media framing, and assist the public to discover media framing phenomenon, which are the major contributions of this research."

In this article this picture is analyzed from the perspective of the ones supposed to put eGovernment into practice. A model to analyze our relation with technology laden governmental development is put forward. The results, resting on a large scale empirical study in a local municipality, show that a remarkably high number of civic servants (acting in their role as citizens) did not see any possibility to change the transformation if they thought it not to serve the citizens.

We illustrate how the use of symbolic power within different logics and conflict of interest has influenced the MIS development. Despite this, we also observe a process which to a great extent has been harmonious.

However, the recent responses of cities like Dallas, New York, and Chicago show the difficulty of marshaling an effective response. The combinatorial complexity of managing information is a major source of the difficulty.

Building on case studies from five countries-”the United States, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and the United Kingdom-”that have adopted Peer to Patent, this study finds that the pattern of adoption is best explained by the underlying network structure of professional and institutional actors that allow policymakers to exchange ideas and learn from others. The informational network framework includes epistemic communities, international organizations, and globalized corporate entities and is affected by other mediating factors such as regulations, peer-to-peer relations, and technology.

Recently, for the EU Tax and Customs Administration (TCA), the realization of this goal has become more visible with the emerging concept of the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO). Businesses in the member states can apply for the AEO certificate. When it is being granted, simplified control procedures and trade facilitation will be provided by the TCA. A possible “win-win situation” can be achieved, with increased trade efficiency and lowered administrative burden. However, without proper selection of trusted business partners, governments may be worse off due to the adverse selection problem caused by information asymmetry. In this paper, we analyze the cause and effect of the adverse selection in the Government-to-Business relationship building. Further, we show that an IT enabled risk assessment approach can effectively eliminate the G2B information asymmetry and solve the adverse selection problem. The AEO assessment approach of DutchTCA is analysed to give a real life application on how IT is enabling the general risk management approach of the DutchTCA."

On one hand, citizens, academics and nonprofit organizations urged government to further refine product quality supervision strategies and install new food safety monitoring mechanisms (Qu, 2009). On the other, because of the popularity of wireless sensor systems and mobile data collection and transferring technologies in goods production, transferring and processing worldwide, they quickly gained their popularity among Chinese national quality control administration (Ruiz-Garcia et al, 2009; Jiang, 2008). The purpose of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive review of China's newly installed mobile and wireless quality control system based on the analysis of both first hand and second hand data. Specifically the study focuses on how changes in monitoring and tracing technologies interact with the current quality control and food safety administration, goods production and supply, and inspection systems. The paper concludes that although China's food quality control administration did attempt to bring new technology to enforce quality control code, the current implementation of mobile and wireless monitoring tools still demonstrates a highly reactive nature. In addition, the distribution of mobile and wireless monitoring device is still very uneven when it comes to different types of food. This to certain extent prevents the government from employing the new tools to their full extent to establish a meaningful monitoring system for further food quality crisis prevention."

We used panel data analysis to test eighteen hypotheses. Results support 5 of the 18 hypotheses, however three of the supported hypothesis resulted in the opposite direction. Results suggest that citizens use digital government mainly to complete electronic transactions with government, and also that they need simple portals to accomplish these tasks. Additionally, our results suggest that, at least at the initial stages, having two delivery channels have a negative impact on government efficiency. Finally, it appears that the relationship between digital government and more general impacts in the competitiveness of a region is not directly linked, at least on the short term."

However, current studies show that there are complex relationships between information technologies, organizations, and institutions. This paper presents a preliminary theory of the co-evolution of organizational networks, institutional frameworks and technology in the development of state government portals. The theory uses the grammars of system dynamics and builds upon institutional approaches to understand interactions among all these factors in the development of information and communication technologies in government. The preliminary theory shows the relevance of networks and relations to successful portal development. Moreover, institutionalization of work practices and methods appears to be also an important success factor, and there are several interactions among the variables identified."

However, when looking closely to practice in the development of policies and projects of this nature, it is rare to find evidence of an assessment of the needs of citizens for the selection, design, and implementation of information technology initiatives in the public sector. It seems that the implementation of e-government projects usually addresses government perspectives and government's perceptions of citizen needs. Based on a telephone survey to 2002 Mexican citizens, this paper argues that citizen-centered strategies to e-government should focus on back-office applications instead of front-end services. This is true even when considering real citizen perspectives and expectations."

Hence, several countries around the world have issued Freedom of Information (FOI) laws and acts, imposing that city administrations develop their own open data portals to publish local open data. However, many cities, specially in developing countries, lack the financial resources even to invest in basic IT services. These cities quite often do not have qualified people in open data best practices, transparency and IT solutions for constructing these portals, specially the middle and small-sized ones. There are many works pointing out guidelines and general problems in open data portals. However, there is a lack of an unified instrument for evaluating and suggesting good practices in constructing open data portals considering both open data portal requirements and FOI access laws and acts. In this work, we propose an instrument for evaluating open data portals that gathers functionalities present in platforms that support open data portals construction and recommendations from FOI access law. Specifically, we used recommendations from Brazilian Information Access Law, as it is an instance of FOI access recommendation. We evaluated and validated our instrument assessing portals of 26 Brazilian cities. Our case study shows that the instrument is effective for showing many problems in these portals, and also reveals the current scenario in these cities."

An important aspect shaping the success of policy making is the use of appropriate tools and instruments to model (public) policy, i.e. to use theories, methods and tools that support the process of transforming data and information inputs into conceptual and formal models, which contribute to transparency, a better understanding of policy options (the causes and effects), and better informed decision-making to improve public performance. Accordingly, policy modelling has recently emerged as a multi-disciplinary research domain advancing distinct approaches to policy development and governance through the use of innovative information and communication technologies (ICT). The complexity encompassed with modelling public policies demands for different – often distinct – political, economic, social and technical disciplines to work together to leverage the benefits of different approaches of understanding policy and designing innovative policy. This paper presents an approach to scientific collaboration in advancing the research field and in collaborating across distinct disciplines, while performing comparative analyses in the area of policy modelling. The comparative analyses are organised in the context of an international network of policy modelling called eGovPoliNet, whose aim is to overcoming the existing research fragmentation between disciplines, thereby driving evolution in the field."

In particular, IT leadership is a critical success factor for every Electronic Government (e-Government) initiative. Most of the leading countries in e-Government development have adopted the Chief Information Officer (GCIO) function to lead and coordinate their technology-related projects. In addition, most influential international e-Government rankings -- like those conducted by United Nations and Waseda University; include the presence of the function in their assessment criteria. However, the adoption of the function entails broader actions than the merely establishment of the position itself. Several prerequisites, such as qualified human resources, coordination and collaboration capabilities, and governance mechanisms, among others, need to be available in government for the proper establishment and sustainability of the function. Despite its broader adoption in practice, there is scarce literature to assist governments in understanding the complexities of the GCIO function and making the prerequisites available.

With the emergence of the web-based crowdsourcing model, participants have become more involved in electronic participation processes. However, according to the literature, CP processes are in some cases, disconnected from citizens' living context and lacking responsiveness. In this paper, we argue the relevance of context in citizen participation and we propose a conceptual model for opinion contextualization that is based on semantic, spatial and temporal dimensions. The contextualization aims to connect citizens' input to relevant contextual variables that would enhance the understanding of concerns and thus to increase participation processes responsiveness. In order to test the proposed approach, a qualitative analysis process was handled based on a random sample of public transportation data in a city in Canada. This study argues the relevance of considering spatial, temporal and semantic dimensions in citizen participation processes."

Subsequent to the evaluation of a number of pioneering projects in this field it has become apparent that merely providing online tools is not sufficient to engage young people democratically. In order to begin to resolve some of the underlying issues a number of interviews with youth consultation coordinators in Scotland have been conducted and youth consultation best practice documents have been researched. This has resulted in the development of four high-level stages, which situate online youth dialogues in a much broader, supporting scheme. Evaluation research is planned through the development and field-testing of further youth consultations. Our work will continue to research ways of developing online youth consultation tools that are both used and useful. At present, as this paper details, it appears that the only way this will occur is if traditional offline techniques are implemented to help alter a cultural view of young people in opposition to what it means to be a citizen."

To address this shortcoming and explore the concept of co-created OGD-driven public services the authors conducted an exploratory case study. The case study explored Chicago’s use of OGD in the co-creation of a predictive analytics model that forecasts critical safety violations at food serving establishments. The results of this exploratory work allowed for new insights to be gained on co-created OGD-driven public services and led to the identification of six factors that seem to play a key role in allowing for a OGD-driven public service to be co-created.

From these definitions models of the trust relationships specific to the implementation of knowledge management within a governmental organisation are developed. As a foundation for the paper we address the nature of knowledge, adhering to current accepted definitions of tacit and explicit knowledge, while introducing a third knowledge type – obscured explicit knowledge. We argue that this third type is a subtype of explicit knowledge, and has been misidentified as tacit knowledge. We also argue that this third type is fundamental to the models. We argue that social acceptance of knowledge management is fundamentally based on trust and subsequently develop the models that describe the complex trust relationships involved in this acceptance."

Institutionalizing a criterion that helps software designers and developers to properly extend or design an RA for a domain-specific, goal-aware and context-aware implementation of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) system has evolved into a necessity. In this article, a criterion derived from understanding existing standard SOA reference architectures is presented. In following presented work, we focus specifically on the eParticipation domain to validate the proposed criterion. The criterion will not only help improve the process of refining and specialising standard SOA-RA, but also provides a set of key ingredients to sustain SOA-RA definition in the eGovernment domain, specifically to sustain information integration in eParticipation."

As can be seen from the discussions on blockchain applications, both practitioners and researchers struggle to get to the core of blockchain technology consequences. Especially practitioners in the governmental sector explore adequate responses to this new technology. Therefore, our aim is to provide a conceptualization of the consequences of blockchain systems from an institutional perspective, and to use this conceptualization to provide insights into the governance of blockchain systems. We use a Grounded Theory approach to conceptualize the institutional consequences of blockchain technology. This approach leads to our core category: power transfer in environments with highly institutionalized values. This core category supports the synthetization of the governance issues related to blockchain systems. We conclude that the controlling powers that were formerly vested in highly institutionalized organizations (such as governments and regulators) and institutions (such as legal frameworks and agreements), are no longer automatically part of the governing ecosystem in blockchain systems but are engrained into the technical system itself. Thus, Blockchain technology enables the technological institutionalization of values in environments that are highly dependent on these values. We believe that this is at the core of why existing institutions are being pressured by blockchain technology, and as such increase the difficulty for governments to effectively govern blockchain systems. Using this notion, public and private parties within the block-chain ecosystems can develop regulatory arrangements and strategies that strike a balance between fostering the innovative power and possibilities that blockchain applications offer and to mitigate possible negative effects of blockchain technology."

There are many expectations related to open government data (OGD) covering e.g. public transportation, car parks, public committee minutes and air quality measurements and the effects of more open public agencies and commercial possibilities, together with citizen benefits. Expectations are often uncritical and expressed in terms of rationalized myths. The purpose of this paper is to investigate myths and realities in a case study and to present lessons learned from focusing such dimensions in an ongoing and emerging local government OGD initiative. This study confirms previous research on open data myths, challenges and benefits from a local government perspective. The conclusions also illustrate three important findings directed to the existing body of research regarding the importance of alliances of stakeholders in OGD initiatives, aspects of heterogeneous organizations launching open data and reflections on the division of labour between public and private actors when handling different communication channels. Implications for research and practice are also outlined together with limitations and further research."

A comparative study is made using IO concepts from industrial markets that characterize an IO relationship (continuity, complexity, symmetry, and formality) and concepts that describe dimensions of such relationships (links, bonds, and ties). The results from the comparative study show that there are several similarities concerning interaction in relations between organizations in the two sectors. There are also differences depending on the level of analysis (empirical level vs. analytical level).

However, social media interactions are emergent and challenging existing bureaucratic norms and regulations. This paper provides empirical evidence for the institutionalization stages government agencies' move through when they are adopting new technologies. Adoption occurs at varying degrees of formalization and not all departments in the U.S. executive branch regulate and restrict the use of new technologies in the same way. The internal procedural and organizational changes that occur during the adoption process are extracted using qualitative interviews with social media directors in the 15 departments which received the executive order to ""harness new technologies"" in order to make the U.S. government more transparent, participatory and collaborative. In addition to the perceptions of federal social media directors, a process tracing approach was used to map the accompanying governance and institutional changes and follow-up orders to direct the adoption of social media. Tracing both the behavior of individual organizations as well as the institutional top-down responses, this paper is both relevant for academics as well as practitioners. It provides the basis for future large-scale research studies across all levels of government, as well as insights into the black box of organizational responses to a top-down political mandate."

The presented approach incorporates citizens and other regional stakeholders (e.g., companies, organizations, associations) as problem-solvers and strongly enables regional stakeholders and the public administration to develop solutions jointly as an ongoing learning process. In this sense, s.TAS addresses participation approaches and elaborates participation to collaboration. For the development of this participatory problem-solving approach, we conducted (1) a broad literature review on participatory approaches and (2) we implemented a qualitative, collaborative research approach with participants from different stakeholder groups.

Hence, the plans of the Western Cape Government (WCG) in South Africa to introduce cloud computing based m-government services on the assumptions that (i) penetration of the mobile phones is almost 100% in this province and (ii) cloud computing can reduce service delivery costs and make government services more accessible and effective. Although recent studies have found that citizens and government officials in the Western Cape perceive m-government services supplied via cloud computing beneficial, and thus likely to be used, deriving benefits from the introduction of the CC based m-government largely still depend on a number of other factors. We have explored the impact of these factors on policy-making using two ICT benefit conceptual models: one found in the Information Management Body of Knowledge (IMBOK) and the Access-Adoption-Appropriation (AAA) model. Based on our literature review we tested our conceptual findings with two focus groups consisting of WCG officials and citizens. We found that these models, if used appropriately, can guide policy-making in this area, by leading government officials toward more effective and efficient service delivery and allow for the citizens' beneficial use of CC based m-government services. We have also acknowledged some limitation of this study as well as some recommendations for the further research."

Such opportunities have been widely noted, in recent years, in processes like Participatory Budgeting (PB). From the originating practices of PB in Brazil, experiences of PB around the world have been uniquely exercised. While some processes leverage widely on the use of ICTs, others do not. The rationale of utilizing ICTs in PB processes with respect to challenges, benefits and resulted public value-add is still unclear. This has created a wide perspective on whether ICTs should be adopted in the traditional PB processes. This paper investigates the added public value through the use of ICTs in PB by comparing three models of participation in PB - offline, online and hybrid models. The comparison of these models reveals insights and understandings of diverse processes, challenges and underlying rationales of ICT use with respect to public value-add. In order to better understand the impact of ICTs to public value in PB, this paper proposes a framework for analyzing public value-add of ICT use in PB processes. The framework is used to assess ICT use in the three models of PB."

Despite the effort, implementation of e-government in developing countries is still rated as not sufficient. Several literatures, such as the UN 2012 survey, investigate challenges faced by developing countries; poor management and limited availability of resources being the main ones. Developing an e-government system with limited resources and with the challenges developing countries are facing requires careful planning. The ultimate question is the public value generated and the sustainability of e-government initiatives in developing countries. Our main question driving the investigation in this paper is, therefore, whether guidelines exist to develop e-government solutions with the goal of public value generation in mind. The investigations of literature have unveiled many guidelines for designing e-government systems. However, there is still lack of a comprehensive framework that will enable developing countries to design e-government systems whilst generating public value. In this paper, existing guidelines for development of e-government systems are first reviewed followed by a comparison among the guidelines. Then the challenges for designing e-government systems in developing countries are outlined. Through a consolidated view emerging from the comparison and the outlined challenges, the paper brings forth a comprehensive strategic framework for successful design of e-government systems. The proposed framework is for policy makers and e-government coordinators to design e-government systems in a way that the objectives are met and that the investments generate public value."

Nevertheless, the challenges encountered and the overall growth of e-government in different countries varies; studies by organizations such as the UN and World Bank evidence these variations. To successfully implement e-government, governments are required to deepen their understanding of aspects such as benefits, challenges and success factors. Contributing to this knowledge and understanding, the paper investigates factors framing successful design and implementation of e-government systems. The paper presents and analyses the literature and results from an e-government inquiry in Germany. The paper highlights important factors for successful implementation of e-government and also presents opinions on strategic aspects for e-government systems design with reference to Germany. It finally highlights the need for further research in the domain."

However, being aware of the challenges of e-government implementation is not sufficient, as challenges may interrelate and impact each other. Therefore, a systematic analysis of the challenges and their interrelationships contributes to providing a better understanding of how to tackle the challenges and how to develop sustainable solutions. This paper aims to investigate existing challenges of e-government and their interdependencies in Tanzania. The collection of e-government challenges in Tanzania is implemented through interviews, desk research and observations of actors in their job. In total, 32 challenges are identified. The subsequent PESTEL analysis studied interrelationships of challenges and identified 34 interrelationships. The analysis of the interrelationships informs policy decision makers of issues to focus on along the planning of successfully implementing the existing e-government strategy in Tanzania. The study also identified future research needs in evaluating the findings through quantitative analysis."

A number of European countries have developed and implemented solutions for public e-procurement at a national level. Despite major initiatives from state level and claims of reduced cost through wider choice and higher efficiency these have been adopted to a less extent than expected by the public sector in some of the countries. Lack of adoption may be due to a number of reasons. Technical problems, costly solutions and competing electronic marketplaces (Somasundaram 2004b) are causes often suggested. Henriksen et. al. (2004) suggests that decentralisation of purchasing power conflicting with centralised solutions may be an important cause in Denmark. In Norway, the governemnts project manager for implementation of e-procurement suggests lack of organisational change as a cause for lack of adoption (Computerworld 2004). We need to identify the reasons for the lack of adoption so that public spending is not wasted. We suggest that institutional theory may help understand the different attitudes towards adoption, and that community goals expressed as concern for the regional business community may be an important institutional factor. The paper outlines a research agenda and presents a tentative research model and a design to test this. The study itself will start early autumn 2004, and preliminary results will be available late 2004."

Three case studies from IS procurement in Norwegian municipalities are presented. By following one of the procurements in detail, the paper shows a process with a very strict phased division, an approach quite different from today’s agile system development methods. The cases show the importance of the requirement specification which is completed before talking to vendors. They also show the need for clarifying the content of the offer, through a dialogue with the vendor. A number of critical incidents are identified, involving the interests of different stakeholders. Continual management of stakeholders and of the procurement process through to implementation and acceptance testing are highlighted."

This paper reports initial results from a Delphi study, which involved 46 experienced procurement managers, chief information officers, and vendor representatives in the Norwegian public sector. The participants identified altogether 98 challenges related to IS procurement, divided further into 13 categories: requirements specification, change management, cooperation among stakeholders, competence, competition, contracting, inter-municipal cooperation, governmental management, procurement process, rules and regulations, technology and infrastructure, vendors, and IT governance. The results contribute by supporting a few previous findings from conceptual and case-based studies, and by suggesting additional issues which deserve both further research and managerial and governmental attention. As such, the results provide altogether a rich overview of the IS procurement challenges in the Norwegian public context."

Among the formulae put forward to set this right is the role played by transparency yet, although initially it was considered that simply rolling out transparency programmes would lead to the intended outcome, subsequently several works established the nonexistence of this relationship or even a decrease in citizens’ trust. One possible explanation for such disparate consequences could be the way in which familiarity or experience affects trust-generating processes. For this reason, this research seeks to analyse, for the case of the UNED, the largest university institution in Spain, the impact that familiarity or user experience has on the relationship between transparency and trust and between this and continued use."

This paper introduces a “process oriented” definition of sustainable eParticipation, based on five key attributes: juridical compliance, legitimacy, social value, efficiency, and productivity. These can be used to assess the level of potential integration of a participatory practice or trial within the legal, political, social and organisational contexts of the public sector institutions involved. We posit that sustainable participation will emerge whenever these five dimensions are not jeopardised, compromised, or are left unaltered, by the introduction of participatory elements into any decision-making process regarding issues of public relevance. Empirical investigation is recommended to assess the impact of specific Preparatory Actions on eParticipation by using the five propositions introduced."

Research has reported intangible factors like leadership, shared goals, open communication, trust, willingness to compromise and collaborate, respect etc. as critical success factors in PPP. This paper illuminates the mechanisms, and develops propositions to explain how and why the intangible factors influence the PPP outcomes. It also applies this framework to an e- Governance project to exemplify and discuss the insights drawn. A social capital paradigm is used to develop the theoretical framework."

It is used by millions of users worldwide everyday. Due to the text limitation on Twitter (140 characters per tweet), URL (Uniform Resource Locator) shortening services are widely used; however they are not free from risks. Shortened URLs are completely different from the original URLs, and hence users have no idea where the short URLs will direct them to. Attackers leverage this knowledge to their advantage to spread malicious URLs. Most of the approaches proposed for classifying malicious URLs utilize information from both social networks and URL shorting service providers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect malicious short URLs using only visible features of tweets and user profiles. We test four machine learning algorithms, i.e., Naïve Bayes, random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression and obtain an accuracy of up to 97% using random forest when classifying malicious short URLs. Our testing results indicate that the approach using visible features from social networks to detect malicious URLs is practicable."

In reality, the responders are often faced with information overload, incomplete information, or a combination of both. This hampers their decision-making process, workflow, situational awareness and, consequently, effective execution of collaborative crisis response. Therefore, getting the right information to the right person at the right time is of crucial importance. The task of processing all data during crisis response situations and determining for whom at a particular moment the information is relevant is not straightforward. When developing an information system to support this task, some important challenges have to be taken into account. These challenges relate to the structure and truthfulness of the used data, the assessment of information relevance, and the dissemination of relevant information in time. While methods and techniques from big data can be used to collect and integrate data, machine learning can be used to build a model for relevance assessments. An example implementation of such a framework of big data is the TAID software system that collects and integrates data communicated between first responders and may send information to crisis responders that were not addressed in the initial communication. As an example of the impact of TAID on crisis response, we show its effect in a simulated crisis response scenario."

Based on the legal latitude of the national legislator, the Federal Constitutional Court confirmed the constitutionality of postal voting several times. In contrast, the constitutionality of electronic voting machines, which were used for parliamentary elections in 2005, was rejected as the possibility to control the essential steps in the election was not given to all citizens. These two cases underscore that the legal system has room to balance legal requirements against each other (postal voting), but that there are limits on what it will allow (electronic voting machines). Without clear guidelines on what is and what is not acceptable, the constitutionality of new voting techniques, in particular Internet voting systems, remains unknown. This work identifies the principles of the legal latitude in the German constitution, and captures that latitude in a model. The proposed model enables a review of the constitutionality of technical proposals to implement Internet voting. Furthermore, this model can act as a common base for legal experts and technical developers to communicate, thus supporting interdisciplinary development."

At this point, a political science view understands the embeddedness of public-sectoral innovation processes in the surrounding politico-administrative system. Therefore, we seek to investigate into public sector innovations in terms of identifying politico-administrative system dynamics which shape the process of their emergence and diffusion. In order provide empirical evidence, we analyse the Japanese case by the means of a series of qualitative-empirical expert interviews. We demonstrate how decentralisation reforms open up innovation potential for local governments, by which means the central government still holds strong influence on innovation and diffusion processes, and which possible paths of eGovernment and NPM innovation manifest as a result."

The results show that citizen involvement in reform processes is not primarily motivated by the aim of cost reduction, but rather related to legitimacy reasons and the intent to increase employee motivation. Based on these findings, implications for (design) theory and practice are discussed: Instead of detailed collaborative business processes modeling, the key of citizen involvement in public sector BPM lies in communication and mutual understanding."

Although e-Inclusion programmes and initiatives changed over the years and, moreover, although the amount of e-Inclusion literature is constantly growing, there is still no thorough understanding of potential factors influencing private internet usage. Hence, in this study we identify important influencing factors based on the literature on technology acceptance and digital divide. We develop a model based on these factors and test it against comprehensive survey data (n=192). Our theoretical model is able to explain more than 70% of the variation in private internet usage.

What are the trends and most influential factors in digital divide? To answer these two questions, the paper uses ITU data for 209 countries between 2010 and 2015. The descriptive statistics show that the key reason for the persistent digital divide seen between regions, countries and socio-economic groups is a financial one! A deep dive correlation analysis finds direct causation between the variable tested, i.e. physical access to the internet (i.e. input factor) and use of internet and internet-based services (i.e. output factor). Mobile infrastructure is found to initially provide better value and faster roll-out of physical access to internet infrastructure, but may not be a long-term solution as the actual use of Internet-based services will lead to increased demand for high-quality bandwidth. The relative cost of internet access is a key challenge to bridge the digital divide between lower income and high-income countries. By comparison, there is only a limited digital divide between low- and high-income groups and rural and urban areas in high-income countries. Findings indicate that once roughly half of a population has physical access to the internet, actual use of Internet-based services reach a tipping point and will automatically increase, thus lending support to Technology Acceptance Models."

At the same time, online-based crowdsourcing concepts have become ubiquitous. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of participatory budget allocation and sketch out an experimental design to assess different alternatives of such a mechanism. Building on the rich literature of threshold public goods and motivation theory, we investigate how different crowdfunding-like mechanisms for budget allocation affect contribution behaviour, user agency, and overall welfare. In a pilot experiment, we find that decisions on institutional budget allocation with no alternative use lead to higher overall welfare gains and more funded projects than an existing outside option (keeping budget for private use), whereas differences in subjects' perceived sense of agency were insignificant. This indicates that institutions can implement such a restricting mechanism without limiting user motivation, while maximizing welfare."

To address such challenges in an efficient and effective way, policy officials require timely and reliable information. Accordingly, the availability of appropriate methods and tools to aggregate scattered pieces of information and stakeholders' expectations is becoming increasingly important. In this paper we focus on the problem of aggregating and interpreting heterogeneous information dispersed among individuals in a timely manner to support public policy making. We propose an approach that involves the creation of belief (Bayesian) networks to model conditional and probabilistic dependencies between policy indices and the use of Information Markets (IMs) for aggregating stakeholder expectations on uncertain policy indices. An example case focusing on predicting Greenhouse Gas emissions shows how our approach can support real life policies and decisions."

However, many barriers and obstacles need to be overcome and sizeable investments are needed. Change processes in organization and culture are slow: it can take several years until the combined investment in information and communication technology, organization and skills deliver the full benefits. Strong political leadership and commitment is needed, guided by a long-term vision on the contribution of the public sector to Europe in the knowledge society. Forward thinking and innovation should be accompanied with concrete deliverables and results in the shorter term. The eGovernment initiative puts pressure on authorities to provide services online and accessible to the citizen. In turn, this necessitates improved information sharing between departments and joint working with other agencies and administration levels. As it is mentioned in [2], the most common eGovernment application is clearly oriented to provide citizens with access to information.

These results are highly inconsistent with the claims of e-democracy advocates. Two important factors account for the lack of e-democracy at the American grassroots: lack of funding and lack of perceived demand.

In exploring various legal, economic, and administrative issues that may have influence on contracting decisions for cybersecurity; and comparing those to traditional IT decision making, we found that the problems in traditional IT contracting are more pronounced in cybersecurity.

Due to the shared locus of power, crowdsourcing is situated at the intersection between government led and citizen led e-Participation. Previous research has shown that a high Sense of Community has positive and significant effects on both internal and external efficacy; translated to government crowdsourcing, it would mean that design features that encouraged a Sense of Community in government crowdsourcing would be best placed to create public value by promoting civic engagement, and enabling the creation of a public that could understand and act in their own interests. As citizens are the arbiters of public value, the second phase of the research looks at the outcomes of government crowdsourcing process from the perspective of the citizen. Proposing that there is a hierarchy of participation; that there are different routes to participation; allowing many different actors with different values to deliberate and learn from the process in different ways according to their needs and time constraints. A key contribution is in the novelty of the subjects being investigated &ndash; as these two constructs, crowdsourcing and public value have to date not been researched together. The outcomes of the research will guide interactions and connections in government crowdsourcing communities through the technical, legal and social capabilities offered to community members, similar to the way that architecture guides people in physical spaces."

At the moment those in cities and towns have access to all they need while people in the rural are mostly in the dark. Kenya's 50 years of political independence ought to have closed the digital and culture divide gap. We are fermenting trouble in Kenya if nothing is done to redress the divide between the haves and the have nots."

A Comparative Analysis of the Public Sector Competences in the German and Australian Higher Education Systems",NA,"10.24251/HICSS.2018.283","Australia has been voted world’s second in the last two United Nations e-government surveys 2014 and 2016, despite the acknowledged difficulties that arise in terms of implementation because of its federal structure. Germany, having a similar federal structure, in contrast, only ranks 15th. The study at hand aims at eliciting, if this development can be ascribed to the higher public administration and e-government education landscape. By means of a content analysis, we examined 126 higher education study programmes with a link to the public sector in Australia and compared them to a similar study in Germany from the year 2015. Results show that there are indeed differences with respect to the delivered contents and the respective competences in Australia that might contribute to the different e-government development in the two countries: Higher levels of socio-technical courses and a more contextualised programme delivery in general are two of the main findings."

Over the years, several solutions have been developed aiming the publishing and sharing of data on the Web. However, existing solutions are mainly focused on how to offer data access. Moreover, other tasks should also be considered, such as the data creation and the data maintenance. In this context, the primary goal of this work is to propose a reference model for a Data on The Web Management System (DWMS). The proposed model offers a collection of services to help data sharing on the Web. In general, such services aim to facilitate the definition, creation, maintenance, manipulation, and sharing of datasets on the Web across multiple users and applications.

As a consequence, data has become a tradable and valuable good. There are now Data Ecosystems, in which a number of actors interact with each other to exchange, produce and consume data. Such ecosystems provide an environment for creating, managing and sustaining data sharing initiatives. Despite Data Ecosystems are gaining importance, until now, there is no common agreement on what theories should look like in Data Ecosystems. The evidence is the lack of a well-accepted definition of the term Data Ecosystem. In order to overcome this gap, in this paper, we investigate some theoretical issues that are relevant for Data Ecosystems. Our main focus is on the aspects related to the components of a Data Ecosystem as well as to propose a common definition for a Data Ecosystem term. Therefore, the aim of our work is two-fold. First, we investigate the state of research on the Data Ecosystem field and related kinds of ecosystems, such as Business and Software Ecosystems to enable the development of a common knowledge base. Second, we extract constructs from relevant studies in order to build a common and cohesive definition for Data Ecosystems."

While Data Ecosystems are thus gaining importance, research into Data Ecosystems is still in its infancy stages. The terminology and definitions for Data Ecosystem vary greatly. This diversity imposes a pressing problem for the development of a clear understanding of the new opportunities and emergent challenges in exploiting Data Ecosystems. Accurate definitions are required to get a mutual understanding of what Data Ecosystems involve. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, a model for describing a Data Ecosystem and its essential concepts has not been proposed yet. In this work, we aim to fill these gaps by reviewing the Data Ecosystem literature, and based on the field literature, we propose a meta-model for describing Data Ecosystems. In particular, the proposed meta-model describes the Data Ecosystem fundamental concepts and their inter-relationships for enabling analysis and description of ecosystems. Especially, the meta-model declares explicitly how all these concepts are related to each other in such holistic view, hence facilitating knowledge creation and management in the ecosystem."

The novel integration of technology and economy that open public block-chains have brought represents both challenges to and opportunities for enhancing digital public services. So far, the public sector has lagged behind other sectors in both research and exploration of this technology, but pilot cases show that there is a great potential for reforming and even transforming public service delivery. We argue that the open blockchain technology is best understood as a possible information infrastructure, given its universal, evolving, open and transparent nature. A comparison with Internet is meaningful despite obvious differences between the two. Based on some case studies, we have developed an analytical framework for better understanding the potential benefits as well as the existing challenges when introducing blockchain technology in the public sector."

Parliamentary-centred democratic procedures, in a newsmedia-saturated society, generate less and less enthusiasm among citizens. Theres no evidence that people are turning anti-democratic, but opinion polls in both western Europe and North America show that in practically all countries, citizens feel gradually more detached from the established political process. Political reality seems to be moving further and further away from the ideals of democracy as described in political science textbooks. Although IT could be designed to support democratic procedures by which citizens could regain the political power they obviously feel they have lost, this is not happening.

However, most of the debates focus on the technology imperatives and / or strategic choices view. The micro-process of institutionalisation involving interplays between actors and structures in forming an institutionalised approach is hardly brought to the surface. Complex structure of government institutions, interaction of actors from various contexts and integration of multiple resources during DEST implementation has made the process of institutionalisation difficult. Combination of Institutional Theory (IT) and Structuration Theory (ST) concepts are used in this paper to examine an exemplar DEST project in the UK -- 'Tell Us Once' (TUO). Findings show that actors and structures played significant roles throughout the institutionalisation stages. The actors reinforced or modified existing structures to suit their actions, and in return, the structure governed the actors' actions, to form desired behaviour. This social phenomenon happened recursively over period of time until a common practice emerged and the desired objective is achieved. The findings provide useful insights on good institutionalisation practices concerning the role of actors and structures within the institutionalisation process."

EMPATIA was targeted to deliver socio-economic and political benefits, such as enhancing citizen-government engagement, increasing public value through PB process, promoting ‘inclusiveness’ among the marginalized groups of citizens, and impeding political discontent that underpins distrust and scepticism towards the government. The attainment of these benefits will be driven by the EMPATIA’s performance. Hence, a performance measurement tools is needed to enable assessment of EMPATIA, empirically. With an aim to propose an integrated performance evaluation metrics, this study presents a set of assessment criteria for multi-channel digitally enabled PB service platforms – especially EMPATIA. Findings from a qualitative, multi-strategies research approach suggest that the metrics should include five key technical and non-technical performance indicators, to be used as the basis for the development of future evaluation instruments. Of major signposts, the metrics would inform key performance aspects to be considered during the PB platform development, and evaluated to indicate the PB platform performance."

Yet research shows that many ICT enabled initiatives have failed to deliver the desired outcomes for public sector organisations. While the evaluation of ICT projects in the last two decades have been primarily based on quantitative measures that focused on economic and technical outputs, recent studies have emerged that highlights the significance of creating public value through ICT projects.

However, the experts reached no significant consensus on the relative importance of the pre-determinants. Instead, we suggest that the identified pre-determinants should be holistically and contextually scrutinized. As a basis for that, we categorized the pre-determinants further into the areas of government-level policy, municipality-level policy, benefits management process, and benefits management toolbox of methods and techniques.

The low level of confidence of Indians and world community in the transparency and efficacy of the government machinery is reflected in the Transparency [46] and competitive rankings [49] which preclude effective utilization of public funds [33]. Research by Kimberley [24] underscores the importance of e-Governance mechanisms to free and fair trade, particularly through Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) interoperability and interconnectivity, data sharing through international standards and process transparency. In view of these issues and other tangible and intangible benefits, Government of India launched National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) in 2006 to promote e-Gov services within the country. E-Procurement was included in NeGP as an Integrated Mission Mode Project (MMP) [36]. However, in the absence of enabling legal framework, e-procurement implementations in India have not been able to fully realize the potential of the system like greater transparency, cost-effectiveness etc. The emerging issues of public procurement like balancing Social, Environmental and Economic considerations are also difficult to address in the prevailing legal environment governing government purchases. Based on the experience gained through qualitative case studies and semi structured interviews of the stakeholders, in this paper we briefly cover legal and policy frameworks related prerequisites for sustainable public procurement in India. Finally we suggest a model national procurement law which could help fulfilling e-procurement expectations in Indian context. The paper extends the existing body of knowledge on e-procurement by comparing legal imperatives of a statue vis-à-vis Critical Success Factors (CSF) in relation to sustainable procurement."

The governments world over are trying to use this medium for reaching out to their citizenry. This migration has been partly driven by transparency, efficiency and wider-access related benefits accrued by automation of government functions. E-Government Procurement (E-GP) is one such area which has drawn attention of politicians and researchers equally. However, studies bring out that E-GP project like any other e-Governance project has 70% chances of failure. Studies also underline that success of any E-GP system among other things, is affected by national culture, project environment (E-Readiness, IT literacy level and technological evolution) and regulatory framework which govern public procurement in a country. Indian government having realized the transparency and efficiency related benefits of E-GP system initiated an aggressive campaign to ensure its speedier implementation through National E-Governance Programme (NeGP) which was launched in 2006. However, recent review by Government of India (GoI) brought out that E-GP usage in the country has been less than satisfactory. In above perspective, this paper aims to undertake Template Analysis of stage-wise importance of 11 Critical Success Factors (CSF) (reported in literature) in E-GP project outcome in Indian context. For covering large landscape of E-GP implementation in India, two representative systems i.e. those implemented by Government of Andhra Pradesh and National Informatics Corporation were selected.

For this purpose, a European survey took place using questionnaires. The results suggest that the tools and technologies currently employed are mainly general purpose and not specifically designed for eParticipation. The results further suggest that success factors can be grouped together in seven categories, namely commitment by the government; usability; combining online with offline channels; a thorough communication and promotion plan; security and privacy; organisational issues; and topics’ complexity and quality of participation. A comparison with published success factors of eGovernment initiatives suggests there are similarities but also significant differences.

As sovereign nations, tribal governments are engaged in complex relationships with other governments: local, state and federal governments. They are frequently in geographically isolated locations, with often-dispersed populations. The capacity to bridge distance can convey benefits for service delivery and civic engagement, and can connect communities with resources for health, economic development, and education. In this paper, we review research on Native American technology use and the limitations of available data. Because of the contrast between residents of urban areas and tribal lands, we examine differences in cell phone, computer and Internet use for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan Native populations, by education and income.

This framework suggests that the material technology cannot be understood in isolation from the way it is appropriated in social processes. It brings to the forefront technologically enabled social practices rather than the technology itself or the actions of human actors and thus avoids technological or social determinism. It highlights the importance of the interplay of the context, social structures and agency factors in the technologically enabled social practices.

Regarding technologies that enable transparency, openness and outside participation (those usually associated with the term Open Government), not only a limited knowledge of the relevant technologies and capabilities, but also cultural and organizational factors can hinder their implementation. In this study we analyze such factors and ask about their relevance in the German speaking region. In the working group Open Government in the interdisciplinary research cooperation ISPRAT e.V. researchers used a methodological mix of qualitative and quantitative data. Four focus groups and six telephone interviews within different levels of management in the public sector were conducted to identify the relevant factors. Furthermore, a representative quantitative survey was extended by study-specific questions. As result, three key areas regarding the potential cultural and organizational barriers are presented: information cultures and divergent interests in agencies, limited innovation potential in organizational cultures and limited communication of strategies. From this analysis, further implications and some recommendations are derived."

Governments in many countries are making innovative use of web portals for effective governance. While doing so one of the major requirements is to make the web portals accessible to all citizens irrespective of their background, physical abilities and age. Accessibility of web portals largely depends on their user- friendliness in terms of design, content, assistive features, and online support. In this work, we have evaluated the accessibility features of fifteen prominent Indian government web portals based on two guidelines, viz., Web Component Accessibility Guideline (WCAG 2.0) and Guidelines for Indian Government Websites (GIGW), while the first one is a standard proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the second one is a standard adopted by the Government of India recently. As part of the ""Digital India"" initiatives, government/semi-government organizations and educational institutions across India have been instructed to redesign their web portals to comply with the accessibility standards at the earliest. Keeping this in view, our work is aimed at finding out deficiencies in some of the frequently used web portals in India with respect to international and national accessibility guidelines. The objective is to help web developers to take care of such deficiencies in web portals so as to meet the expectations of a wide range of user groups."

This requires an enormous amount of data acquisition, analysis, and processing. Normally, such databases contain references to private information of different stakeholders. It is the responsibility of the government to protect the data against privacy disclosure which can be maneuvered through direct or indirect inference by linking different databases. Though governments have adopted policies to control privacy but still there are technical issues and even the data analyst may turn out to be the one responsible for privacy disclosure. k-anonymity is one of the frequently used approaches to ensure privacy preservation in such scenarios by transforming a database to a sanitize database such that the probability of disclosure is minimized. However, this may lead to information loss and thus reduce the utility for data analysis. Therefore, it is always a challenge that while providing privacy of data through k-anonymity one must ensure minimum information loss without hampering the utility of data. Towards this end, we analyze the efficiency of two existing greedy heuristic based techniques, viz., Datafly and Improved Greedy heuristic and we propose two Local Beam Search based algorithms: Sequential Local Beam Search (SLBS) and Binary search based Sequential Local Beam Search (BSLBS). A comparative analysis of the algorithms is done with the help of Information Loss metric Info.Loss. It is observed that BSLBS outperforms the existing greedy based heuristic methods."

One of the approaches is the total cost of ownership (TCO) where the costs are approached holistically so that, for example, IT costs per workstation, per person, or per IT staff can be presented. TCO is then used in arguing that a certain IT investment is needed because their TCO is better, worse, or different than of the others' TCO. In this paper we argue that this approach is incorrect and does not provide reliable basis for arguments or comparisons. We demonstrate this through analyzing three ministries' IT expenditures and a purchaser-provider split model and its pricing structure. We propose that as we cannot provide a reliable basis for cost-based reasoning, we should not speak about it but pass it over in silence. The need for new metrics and methods is thus evident."

International studies document that eGovernment has become a well known phrase in many countries worldwide. There are, however, significant differences in their respective development. Many administrations use the internet technology just to provide information1. The opportunity to generate additional revenues through integrative IT-solutions is rarely used2. The challenge of performing additional tasks within a declining budget forces governments to develop new ideas in order to increase revenues or to reduce costs. This could be a future business for administrations. In the past, most administrations tried to realize e-government by establishing their own website. Current initiatives concentrate on transactional aspects trying to connect specialized systems with the web. Strategic concepts focusing on architecture and service portfolios are becoming more and more important3. In addition to the political and administrative part of eGovernment, there is also a commercial aspect of services.

However, extracting information of interest from Social Media streams is a challenging task and requires support from domain specific language resources such as lexica. This work describes our efforts at developing a Knowledge Extraction and Management component which employs a lexicon for extracting information related to public services in Social Media contents or streams as part of a holistic technology infrastructure for citizen-led e-Participation. Our approach consists of three basic steps – (1) acquisition and refinement of public service catalogues, (2) organization of the public service names into a lexicon based on different semantic similarity measures and (3) development of a dictionary-based Named Entity Recognizer (NER) or “spotter” based on the lexicon. We evaluate the performance of the NER solution supported by contextual information generated by two well-known general-purpose information NER tools (DBpedia Spotlight and Alchemy) on a dataset of tweets. Results show that our strategy to domain specific information extraction from Social Media is effective. We conclude with a scenario on how our approach could be scaled-up to extract other types of information from citizen discussions on Social Media."

This work bridges this gap by providing a rich conceptualization and corresponding formal and executable ontology for deliberation in the context of e-participation. The semantic model covers the core concepts of technology-mediated political discussion and explicitly supports the integrated citizen- and government-led model of e-Participation enabled by social media. Results from the use of the ontology in describing e-Participation deliberation information at Local Government projects are also presented."

Many cities are actively working to build or transform their models toward that of a Smart City. There is constant research and reports devoted to measuring the intelligence of cities through establishing specific methodologies and indicators (grouped by various criteria). We believe the subject lacks a certain uniformity, which we aim to redress in this paper by suggesting a framework for properly measuring the smart level of a city. Cities are complex and heterogeneous structures, which complicates comparisons between them. To address this we propose an N--dimensional measurement framework where each level or dimension supplies information of interest that is evaluated independently. As a result, the measure of a city's intelligence is the result of the evaluations obtained for each of these levels. To this end, we have typified the transformation (city to smart city) and the measurement (smart city ranking) processes."

Before conducting an election using electronic voting, technical standards and legal issues have to be solved. In Austria the social partnership model is built upon numerous public corporations, such as the chamber of Commerce or the Student Union. These corporations suffer in contrast to elections to the national parliament from a low voter turnout. As e-voting is seen as one measure to raise voter participation, the Austrian national parliament passed the Student Union bill on 1st of February 2001 that allows e-voting in the context of the bi-annual student elections. In this paper the authors present e-voting in the Student Union in a three-fold way. First the legal situation is addressed, then the acceptance of e-voting by voters and finally the technical solution of a two phased method that is used for a test election during the 2003 Student Union elections. It is based on a Kerberos-style algorithm designed to guarantee the separation of the identification process and the registration process as well as to prevent a malicious server administration from generating fake votes."

The data are secondary and were obtained through a Municipal Basic Information Study (MUNIC) conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in 2012. The main elements of the analysis were the ICT infrastructure of local governments and authorities, the internet access infrastructure of municipalities, e-administration and e-service resources, communication with the public, the accessibility of sites for people with special needs and digital inclusion. Socio-economic indicators were also used, including the Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M), per capita income and population size. The main result was the identification of five distinct municipal profiles in terms of ICT use and infrastructure. The size of a town is not a determining factor for local governments to use and make web based services available to its citizens. Many towns remain lacking in basic infrastructure, with every profile showing different needs. As a result, there are a few strong patterns of e-government development and local conditions that could be treated as the foundation for some different policy packages that would be appropriate in these five situations."

However, there is a lack of insight into what drives citizens to engage in OGD initiatives. Such insight helps inform policymakers in stimulating and improving the engage ability of an OGD program. This study aims to identify factors that influence why citizens engage in OGD initiatives. To attain this objective, we conducted a single case study of citizen engagement in an open election data initiative in Indonesia. Our study shows that social altruism as an intrinsic motivation is a strong driver for citizens to start and continue engaging with open election data. Low data quality appeared not to hinder citizens from engaging in the OGD initiative; in contrast, it can lead to more engagement. Election is typically concerning with political participation, yet trust and political efficacy factors only marginally influenced citizen engagement in our case study. The case shows that, in a time-critical situation where potential social conflicts were seen to threaten the citizens' lives, collective actions are enabled by the availability of OGD. We draw some key lessons learnt for policymakers to enhance OGD engage ability. Further research is needed to examine whether factors found in this particular case also apply in different settings."

Most cases are trapped in the system due to a huge backlog of cases, excessive litigation in urban areas, corruption by the court staff and lack of proper monitoring of the functioning of courts. Efficient supervision and monitoring of courts can help in resolving some of the key problems in the system. We present preliminary results from a novel case record-keeping, management and monitoring solution that is able to meet several key performance goals of the National Judicial Policy. The overall aim of the work is to facilitate the work of the monitoring judges by helping them find the proverbial needle in the haystack and not get deluged by the volume of data routinely produced by the typical case-management systems. In this paper, we explore the application of intrusion detection techniques, such as the statistical anomaly detection schemes, to case management systems and present the results from our extensive case studies. Our proposed system, now in pilot, shows high accuracy in flagging anomalous cases, reduces the overall volume of information generated by the system and can help target several of the key reasons behind case pendency while bringing much needed transparency to the overall case-flow."

It also collected and reviewed studies (in English language) on information quality of E-Government websites in a systematic way. It is a systematic review that followed the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA-P) guidelines. An inclusive logical search was carried out in April 2017 among different scholarly databases. The search strategy was narrowed down in TITLE-ABSTR-KEY fields. Kindari's (2011) information quality framework was used to review IQ indicators of E-Government websites. Information quality is a resource that serves as a tool to satisfy the users' needs. Findings of the study reveal that the IQ of E-Government websites are overall good as perceived by the citizens and citizens also consider it important. Information quality has influence on the usefulness of E-Government websites. Reliability, security and privacy dimensions have a major effect on the perceived usefulness of E-Government websites. Accuracy, completeness, ease of use, reliability, security and relevance are the most significant IQ indicators of E-Government websites and citizens are satisfied with them. Fifty IQ indicators were identified and discussed in reviewed studies and among them twenty IQ indicators were found in IQ framework. However there is diversity in the citizens' perception about IQ of E-Gov. websites in terms of significant and insignificant IQ indicators. This systematic review was limited to information quality dimension of e-government websites as well as this review consisted on studies published in English language. It may be possible that some good studies have missed due to publishing in language other than English. Researchers used the term information quality for the systematic review of articles. But other terms may also be used for Information quality i.e. data quality, service quality, citizen-centered e-government services, website quality, Information system quality, financial statement quality etc. So the articles that used these terms interchangeably with information quality may have been missed in systematic review. The findings will be helpful for E-Government website developers and managers to design and deliver more citizen centered services through E-Government websites with reliable, accurate, and up-to-date information. The findings of the study provide implications for E-Government websites' researchers that there should be a standard framework/model to assess information quality of E-Government websites."

For this governments have embraced smart parking initiatives, which should result in a high utilization of public space and minimization of the driving, in this way reducing the emissions of cars. Yet, simply opening data about the availability of public spaces results in more congestions as multiple cars might be heading for the same parking space. In this work, we propose a Multiple Criteria based Parking space Reservation (MCPR) algorithm, for reserving a space for a user to deal with parking space in a fair way. Users' requirements are the main driving factor for the algorithm and used as criteria in MCPR. To evaluate the algorithm, simulations for three set of user preferences were made. The simulation results show that the algorithm satisfied the users' request fairly for all the three preferences. The algorithm helps users automatically to find a parking space according to the users' requirements. The algorithm can be used in a smart parking system to search for a parking space on behalf of user and send parking space information to the user."

These machine-readable datasets enable the creation of applications that help the population in several ways, giving them the opportunity to actively participate in governance processes, such as decision taking and policy-making. While the number of open data portals grows over the years, researchers have been able to identify recurrent problems with the data they provide, such as lack of data standards, difficulty in data access and poor understandability. Such issues make difficult the effective use of data. Several works in literature propose different approaches to mitigate these issues, based on novel or well-known data management techniques. However, there is a lack of general frameworks for tackling these problems. On the other hand, data governance has been applied in large companies to manage data problems, ensuring that data meets business needs and become organizational assets. In this paper, firstly, we highlight the main drawbacks pointed out in literature for government open data portals. Eventually, we bring around how data governance can tackle much of the issues identified."

Reflections after a Research on Tourism and Cultural Heritage",NA,"10.1007/978-3-642-15158-3_12","Cultural Heritage and Tourism Development may be strong driving factors for local policies and may have great importance in strategic decision making at territorial level; then, they may be important subjects for eParticipation studies. But this paper demonstrates, through a literature review, that today’s disciplinary shape of eParticipation as a research field is not suitable to effectively investigate participatory processes related to Tourism and Cultural Heritage. Then, by presenting a field research, which took place in the Italian city of Genoa, and by confronting its outcomes with some most widespread disciplinary eParticipation underpinnings, the paper seeks to identify some areas where a widened disciplinary scope is particularly needed. Finally, we propose a new disciplinary framework, suitable to address also Cultural Heritage and Tourism Development eParticipation processes."

How quickly do lawmakers act and how fast is the acceleration of policy-making processes? To this day political science has not succeeded in analysing these time-related questions concerning the legislature and the time-strategic actions of political actors comprehensively and quantitatively. So far a vast, ample database comprising said information does not exist. Such a lack seems surprising as time as a resource in policy-making is extraordinarily relevant and the collection of necessary information on the German legislature is at least technologically possible today. This paper therefore puts its scientific focus on above-mentioned methodological challenges. It points out how important temporality is to the research on decision-making processes and it presents a database which will list every single procedural step within any given legislative process. The foundation for all raw data is formed by the entire body of indexes of legislative material, issued and published by the Parliamentary Archives of the German Bundestag for every law respectively. All requested pieces of information are obtained by the means of a computer-assisted read-out. Thereby and for the first time, research on the temporal dimensions of policy-making – its duration, pace and acceleration – will become adequately accessible to analysis."

The critical need for such systems in developing countries has inspired this research. Using design science research methodology, meta-requirements for system design were extracted from relevant kernel theories, design principles inferred and a prototype instantiated. A total of 104 participants (55 male, 49 female) from three villages located in Guntur District, India, interacted with the prototype and completed a survey questionnaire, which was followed by focus group discussions and 31 semi-structured interviews. Results revealed that in spite of 100% access to personal mobile phones, user interaction with the prototype was less than 20% and attributed to limitations imposed by a fragmented and highly competitive mobile ecosystem characterized by conflicting billing plans, wide variation in device affordances and interoperability problems between competing networks. Analysis of data further suggests that the access and use of mobile technology at the micro-level (individual) is an informative indicator of the impact of the macro-level, regulatory policies promulgated by the government. As a workaround to the observed limitations, this research proposes a design that 'piggybacks' on extant channels of communication. And as an aside, this research also delineates how the juxtaposition of the ICT policies - aimed at creating a market state - with the social welfare policies - aimed at safeguarding a welfare state - has led to unintended consequences."

To build them, local authorities require multi-disciplinary teams with different competences and responsibilities. Many of these teams are external to the municipality and in the position of sub-contractors. With so many actors involved, the result is often a complex mesh of incoherent spatial data. Overcoming this problem often leads to huge overheads for the public administration.

The results obtained suggest that policy makers are willing to implement Web 2.0 technologies in providing public services, but preferably under the Bureaucratic model framework, thus retaining a leading role in this implementation. The learning curve of local governments in the use of Web 2.0 technologies is a factor that could influence policy makers' perceptions.

Nonetheless, there is a relative absence of empirical investigation of either the normative propositions of public value (understood as the framework for increasing the quality of life in the urban environment) or its efficacy as a framework for understanding public management. Therefore, this paper seeks to analyze whether the smart cities are those with a higher quality of life in the urban environment. The empirical research on a sample of European smart cities indicate that smart city's promise of increasing the quality of life of citizens come true, not as a consequence of city participation in smart forums or working groups, but the outcomes achieved in the city and its impact on citizens' lives, as well as on the need of citizen participation in city policies and decisions."

Nevertheless, ensuring the consistency of transactions stills remains an open issue. While database transactional protocols (such as two-phase-commit) have been largely applied to enforce data consistency in distributed database systems, they have a limited application in SOA-based environments. Furthermore, providing users a consistent view of the executed business processes requires, among others, using a process notation including transactions as first-class element as well as exception handling mechanisms to address some of these problems. It also requires applying design and modeling best practices and execution guidelines, such as process patterns, to obtain business process models with the desired quality characteristics.

What makes SN IOS specifically interesting is that their development and implementation is driven by supranational bodies (rather than businesses or national governments), implying that Member States have given up some of their decision-making power to higher level bodies and are bound to implement the decisions of these bodies. A key question then becomes: Are the processes for standards and system development and adoption of SN IOS distinct from IOS processes driven by businesses or national governments and, if so, what makes them different? Building on a novel typology and a case study of one SN IOS, our findings suggest that both industry and SN IOS exhibit similarities in terms of the role that intermediary organizations play as well as the processes through which standards are negotiated. These similarities can be used for transferability of knowledge between the two domains. We also demonstrate that there are inherent differences in terms of drivers, focus, approach, adoption incentives and the role of national governments. These differences require further attention and different considerations."

The findings indicate various uses of Facebook among the respondents, and a dissonance between what the politicians state as being important (engaging in dialogue with citizens) and what they really do (posting statements). We conclude our paper by discussing the use and usefulness of our proposed model, and by summarising how, why and with whom local politicians use social media."

According to our results, public managers working on OG initiatives perceive OG through three different lenses: a) democratic values of co-responsibility, b) technological innovation, and c) availability and access to information. This new categorization of OG perspectives provides a valuable contribution to the scientific debate about what OG is and how this new public management strategy is perceived by local government managers."

The prevailing attitude towards data security offers an illuminating example of the new encounter between technology and law. A look at legislation and legal practice in this area reveals a variety of approaches. I present these and go on to argue for a position whereby data secu- rity can and should be assessed in terms of fundamental rights. We have a right to data security in the information infrastructure. At the same time, it must be pointed out that, if we are to avoid the potential risks involved, data security must quite literally be security, whereas legal regulation strives for certainty. When we attempt to forestall risks, the degrees of security and certainty needed at any given time should, in the final analysis, be assessed from the standpoint of fundamental rights."

Positive interactions with police help residents to feel safe. In developing countries, residents have started to use Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Facebook to share concerns and seek solutions. In this study, we investigate whether residents' post on OSN contain actionable information that police can use to address safety concerns and how residents use OSN to communicate with police. For this, we analyze residents' posts and comments on the Facebook page of Bangalore City Police, India, over a period of one month. Our results show that residents post information (including location) about various crimes such as neighborhood issues (drunkards, illegal construction), financial frauds, property crime, and thefts. In addition to crime, Facebook page gives information on residents' satisfaction and police performance. Majority of residents use police Facebook page to appreciate the good work of police. Police response to residents' post vary from ignore, acknowledge, reply, and follow-up. We find that police respond to most residents' post and help residents to reach the authority who can help solve the issue. Police adopt a formal communication style to interact with residents. We find that in addition to actionable information, OSN can help understand fear of crime among residents and develop mutual accountability between police and residents."

Prior research has focused on infrastructure, technology, and social components when discussing smart city structure. In this paper, we explore key elements within the soft aspects of smart city initiatives enabling the organization of a dynamic structure. To do so, we focus on human behavior, which we illustrate by analyzing online activities in two cases: one is related to a smart city while the other focuses on an online community. Based on the analysis, we identify key elements that reveal how people participate and become engaged in order to provide lessons to be taken into account within smart city initiatives. Within online activities, the key elements we note are related to knowledge generation, information sharing of common interests, and the creation of collective action."

A Capital Resiliency Model for Disaster Preparedness",NA,"10.1109/HICSS.2016.359","This paper explores how organizational processes are recreated following their destruction in unexpected disasters. It applies the notion of an organization as a capital conversion and capital creation system. It also focuses on systems resilience, the measure of a system's persistence and ability to absorb disturbances while reconstructing relationships between system entities. Based on the analysis of empirical evidence collected from the Great East Japan Earthquake disaster in 2011, we propose a resiliency model incorporating a broader interpretation of the notion of capital. The model consists of five dimensions of capital: economic, social, symbolic, human, and organizational. Once a given capital is destroyed together with its creative organizational processes, communities will attempt to regain resilience by compensating with other dimensions of capital. Analyses demonstrate the importance of recreating organizational capital that coordinates capital conversion and recreation processes to meet the vital need of the residents. Examining this process of capital conversion and creation enables us to extend the notion of resilience."
"853","conferencePaper",2009,"Salhofer, Peter; Stadlhofer, Bernd; Tretter, Gerald","Ontology Driven e-Government",NA,"10.1109/ICSEA.2009.61","This paper presents an approach to model ontologies for the e-Government domain as a basis for an integrated e-Government environment. Over the last couple of years the application of semantic methodologies and technologies in the e-Government domain has become an important field of research. A significant number of these approaches aim at automatic service discovery and service orchestration (Lu et al. 2004) (Crichton et al. 2007) by adding and utilizing semantic annotations to web services. In contrast to these approaches it was our idea to use semantic methodologies in a more forward-engineering manner - to create a semantic model first and to use this model e.g. for service selection but also as basis for the automatic generation of “intelligent” web forms. Thus the ontologies can be seen as a model that forms the basis of a Model Driven Architecture (Miller et al. 2001) approach to e-Government. That is why we call it Ontology Driven e-Government. The principle is rather straightforward. Every public service is semantically modeled and contains references to the required input elements. Any constraints on the service input element - also known as preconditions - can be expressed by semantic rules and evaluated by semantic reasoners. This allows for an automatic creation of (web) forms and interactive plausibility checks of data gathered from the user. Instead of scattering logic over numerous functions and procedures in all possible layers of an application, it is now consistently kept in the semantic model. Another key advantage of this approach is that the knowledge of public services becomes available in a machine processable form which allows for much more than just forms creation. Discovering the citizen's actual goal is one of these use-cases and is actually a very central and important step. When developing the idea of ontology driven e-Government it was one main idea to achieve a strong decoupling between the form solution and the backend. Such a decoupling can be achieved by transforming the input data into a common data interchange standard format, which was EDIAKT II (Freitter et al. 2006) - an XML Schema definition for the exchange of electronic documents between public authorities in Austria - in our case. Following this approach the input data can be consumed by any application supporting the data interchange standard EDIAKT II like the SOA-backend also proposed in this paper."

In particular, Twitter has played a significant role in influencing government decision making and shaping the relationships between governments, citizens, politicians, and other stakeholders. Within the last few months, some commentators even argue that Mexican politics has a new influential actor: ""I'm Number 132"" (a student-based social movement using Twitter and YouTube). After the Arab Spring and the uprisings that have led to significant political changes in Egypt, Tunisia, and Iran, the Mexican case could provide new insights to understand these social movements. Understanding the students' political mobilization ""I'm Number 132"" in the context of the 2012 presidential election in Mexico, and how they have been using social media tools to communicate their concerns and organize protests across the country, could help us to explain why and how these social media-enabled political movements emerge and evolve."

This paper will thus consider aspects of the following puzzle: why does participation increase with increased access to information and information technology among politically engaged individuals, but not among those who have not participated in the past or who self-identify as unengaged? Specifically, this preliminary analysis will consider dimensions of information access -- availability, awareness, and ability to use -- stratified by differences in political participation, as measured by consciousness, resource contributions, institutionalized actions, and public forum participation.

It provides a social context for practitioners, often distributed across multiple organizations, and emerged over the last few decades as a fundamental mechanism for knowledge sharing, management, and generation within organizations. Best practices, innovations, and solutions to shared problems first emerge within CoPs. These are, and must be perceived as, an investment in organizations' future and competitiveness. Establishing a CoP is a straightforward process, the most challenging factor being the recruitment of members to attain critical mass. The challenge is to maintain the CoP active, with members contributing with high quality, innovative content. Increasing a CoP's medium / long-term survival probabilities requires careful planning to avoid incurring in some well-known pitfalls. This paper proposes and discusses a set of nine guidelines for establishing and maintaining a community of practice within the context of Electronic Governance (EGOV) and Government Chief Information Officers (GCIO). This research was motivated by the initiative of the government of a developing country. Results are based on a review of the relevant literature, together with the detailed analysis of interviews to members or coordinators of large communities of practice. This analysis was further validated against the opinions of public servants directly involved on EGOV-GCIO-related functions during two focus groups meetings."

With the unfolding of electronic government (e-government) changes to the way government works also seem to be imminent. Electronic government increasingly impacts business processes and workflows in the public sector. The BPC/ICT research, hence, has the capacity to directly inform both the research and practice of electronic government. In this paper, the findings of the BPC/ICT literature are reviewed and discussed regarding their applicability to electronic government. Both the theory and preliminary empirical evidence suggest that electronic government must be seen as a special case of ICT-enabled business process change."

In this exploratory study, the existing literature on BPC-related strategic approaches and objectives is used as a point of reference for assessing the scope and scale e-Gov-induced BPC. On a grand scale, the strategic approaches and objectives were found very similar to those used in the private sector, although they differed in many details.

While one group of e-Gov researchers emphasizes the transformational impact of e-Gov on the business of government, others have squarely questioned this assertion. This paper contributes to the debate and to the definition of the research agenda by discussing various dimensions of organizational transformation, and how they relate to the phenomenon of e-Gov.

One possible solution to the dilemma of shrinking resources and increasing demands is open innovation. Various papers have already established the idea of crowdsourcing as a means of open innovation in the public sector. In order to enrich theory and practice in the field of collaborative innovation processes, this research focuses on the willingness of citizens to participate in crowdsourcing for innovation. More specifically, we highlight the role of expert citizens in selective crowdsourcing for complex tasks in the public sector with the concrete example of process innovations. We examine different levels of willingness to participate in crowdsourcing by means of a quantitative analysis of a questionnaire survey with n=128 German citizens. Our analysis shows that citizens are indeed motivated to participate in selective crowdsourcing to generate solutions to complex problems in the public sector. Although mobilizing adequate experts for complex tasks may seem challenging, we find that expert citizens actually have a higher willingness to collaborate on complex as well as simple tasks than non-experts. Additionally, financial incentives remain a relevant instrument in the design of citizensourcing projects. Ultimately, the role of age as an influence to participate in crowdsourcing will be discussed."

The results show that most projects require and request data during site visits (e.g., IP address, browser type) and for active participation (e.g., name, email). The real benefit, however, for the use of web analytics is often unclear. Furthermore, often proprietary solutions for web analytics are used, even tough open source solutions (i.e. that store data locally) exist.

Usually, these information needs are modular and can be satisfied by any instrument composed from the required set of assessment components. In this paper, we examine the requirements for a readiness assessment framework to support e-government planning and propose an assessment framework consisting of a set of assessment perspectives. Each of these perspectives is mapped to a corresponding set of concrete assessment components (partly derived from other major e-government assessment frameworks) satisfying the information requirements of these perspectives. The componentized framework allows for easy substitution or specialization of specific components to suit different contexts or assessment scenarios. As an example, we show how this framework can be used for developing a readiness assessment instrument to support e-government planning in Maldives."

Common Service Centres (CSCs) are envisaged as one of the pillars of the delivery mechanism of e-Government services in rural areas where the availability of Internet, literacy levels of citizens and PC penetration is rather low. This channel of delivery is quite different from that of developed countries because citizens do not interact directly with technology. An intermediary called as the Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) delivers the services to the citizens and technology is manifested to the citizens by results of his interactions at the CSC. The study aims to develop a conceptual framework for adoption of CSCs by the citizens in this unique context. A qualitative study is carried out to identify the factors that can augment the technology adoption constructs. The study reveals that quality of service delivered at CSC may be an important determinant for adoption of CSCs. The proposed conceptual framework is intended to form the basis of future empirical studies in similar context in India and in other developing countries."

The information gained from CEMS in power plants was used in an emissions trading program to curb the emission of these hazardous pollutants. This paper investigates whether the use of Information System (IS) technology such as the CEMS are helpful in changing a plant's emission levels. Results suggest that the interaction of cap-and-trade policy with CEMS is crucial to reduce emission of hazardous pollutants thereby improving environmental performance. At the same time, installation of CEMS also provided complementary benefits to power plants in curbing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions not regulated under Title IV of the 1990 amendment of the CAA."

Since citizens who have beneficial awareness or knowledge are not always experts on relevant social issues, assessing and sharing public concerns are needed to reduce barriers to public participation. We propose two approaches to assess public concerns. The first is building a linked open data set by extracting public goals for a specific social issue aimed at by citizens or agents from articles or public opinions. This paper deals with hierarchical goals and subgoals for recovery and revitalization from the Great East Japan Earthquake manually extracted from related articles. The data set can be used for developing services to match citizens and agents who aim at similar goals to facilitate collaboration. The second approach is building a linked data set by extracting assessment criteria for a specific social issue from public opinions. This paper deals with candidate terms that potentially represent such criteria for a specific public project automatically extracted from clusters of citizens' opinions. The data set can be used as evidence for policy-making about the target project."

The problem, shared by virtually all the governments, is becoming a priority also for countries, such as Mozambique, that have started their ICT policy relatively recently and for which it is now evident that — if no particular attention is devoted to the interoperability of the solutions being developed — the result will rapidly become a patchwork of solutions incompatible with each other. The focus of the paper is on formulation of eGIF4M: eGovernment Interoperability Framework for Mozambique. The framework is based on a holistic approach. It builds on top of the existing experiences in eGIFs all over the world and it addresses some specific needs and peculiarities of developing countries, like Mozambique. The result is a comprehensive framework based on: (i) a reference architecture along with technical standards, (ii) a standardization life cycle, (iii) a maturity model, and (iv) some key actions meant to make the initiative sustainable in the longer term."

However, since the development and use of this kind of technology is still at its early stages in the public sector, research about the use of Web 2.0 in this domain is still highly tentative and lacks theoretical underpinning. This paper reports the preliminary findings of an in-depth case study in the United Kingdom (UK) public sector, which explore the application of Web 2.0 technologies in the local government authority (LGA). The findings elicited from the case study offer an insight into information systems (IS) evaluation criterions and impact factors of Web 2.0 from both a practical setting and an internal organisational perspective. This paper concludes that a combined analysis of the evaluation and impact factors rather than a singular approach would better assist the decision making process that leads to effective application of Web 2.0 technologies.

With an increased demand for such services, coordination as an internal organizational phenomenon is becoming increasingly important. Based on a qualitative case study, and informed by coordination theory, this paper investigates two different theoretical views applied on internal e-service coordination within a government agency in Sweden. At the outset, the agency is seeking one generic way to coordinate the current heterogeneous and fragmented internal e-service landscape in a more efficient way. Hence, our aim also includes investigating the prerequisites and potential for this type of coordination. We conduct this study in two stages. First, we apply a well-established theoretical lens from organizational theory on a set of coordination efforts, thereby perceiving coordination as a planned and anticipated activity based on a fixed set of mechanisms. Second, we apply a lens of coordinating as emergent practice, which allows for an in-depth investigation of more flexible and dynamic aspects of coordinating activities in daily work. By combining these two views, we argue that this approach can facilitate and increase understanding of the dynamics and flexibility needed to understand the type of coordination needed in public e-service contexts. This can also imply that there is no single best practice or ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to internal e-service coordination. Instead, organizations need to acknowledge the need for multi-dimensional views revealing the inherent complexity of coordination; as planned as well as emerging activities."

To address this shortcoming, we studied a complex, e-government case involving 38 government agencies intending to co-create value from a common IT platform. We used a mixed method approach, involving both qualitative and quantitative data. Data analysis was guided by two strands of theory, namely the theory of institutional entrepreneurship and the co-creation of IT value. Our findings suggest that neither theory is sufficient to provide a processual7 understanding of co-creation.

The aim is to make a threefold contribution of international scope and significance to the eGovernment debate by mapping Italy’s chosen path to public-sector innovation. Framing the country’s digital agenda within the larger picture of ongoing New Public Management-driven administrative reforms, the authors assess whether mandating an arm’s length body to steer the eGovernment strategies at public-sector macro level has been successful. The structural-instrumental, cultural and environmental lens used to analyse the key contextual factors shows how the continuity and discontinuity that has shadowed Italy’s ICT policies can be blamed on shifts in leadership and diverse ideas of modernization; on the digital agency’s multiple, even conflicting mandates; and on the misalignment of the ‘original agency model’ with the public machinery’s embedded culture."

Our approach has been to make use of the process theory on business value generation developed by Soh and Markus (1993), adapting the original framework of analysis to the public sector. According to these authors, IT can generate business value through a three-phase process: conversion, use and competitive deployment. We focus on the first stage of the model, where IT expenditures are converted into IT assets. The role of Web services technology in this conversion process is then depicted, evidencing some implications connected to its adoption in e-Government (e-Gov) projects. The analysis is intentionally limited to the intra-organizational level (i. e. we do not consider inter-agency systems) and to the first phase of the value generation process.

This portal is based on a powerful meta-database of all available resources and services of the federation, the cantons and the districts and allocates a unique name, the URN (Uniform Resource Name), to every resource. The URN:Technology, adapted to the requirements of www.ch.ch, became an open standard and a building block of the Swiss e-government platform. This article highlights the URN:Technology and shows how portals in powerful and established federal structures benefit from this innovation. URN:Technology represents nowadays a key factor in the success of building and operating large portals with split responsibility for the content and interlinking. The present meta-database of URN:Technology, already similar to UDDI, can be developed with the help of web services into a registry with UDDI conformity."

The more direct democracy facilitated by social media outlets fascinates communication and political science researchers. But while most of their attention is drawn to national politics, the municipal arena can be even more affected by these new means of direct communication. This paper focuses on municipal administration on Facebook, and analyzes the discourse that has developed between citizens and local administrators on municipal Facebook pages, using automatic digital tools. The formal Facebook pages of all of the cities in Israel were extracted using digital tools, and all posts and comments published on these pages in a period of six months were analyzed using automatic linguistic analysis tools that provided information regarding the use and frequencies of words and terms in the texts. The paper presents the prominent topics, use of language, and basic features of citizens--municipalities interactions in formal Facebook pages.

Such activities fall within the scope of the e-Government research field. Developing large-scale information systems has proven to be a challenging task and many initiatives have ended in failure. This paper explores uncertainty in the e-Government context. How is it related to the various actors in the public sector, and how can decision making be adapted here to improve value realization? Using actor-network theory as an analytical lens, the collaboration of five Swedish municipalities in creating common e-services is examined as a case study. The results indicate that factors beyond decision makers' control, such as relations outside of a project, create a high degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty can be reduced by creating durable relations between local and global socio-technical actors. Inscribing values into generic software that has a high grade of interoperability should help to strengthen these networks beyond projects and regional borders."

Interoperability can conceptually be understood as properties of a system and its context. The properties of democratic systems are often ill-suited for interoperability and, as such, enablers for interoperability might disrupt a country's constitutional design. Hence, there is a need to advance our knowledge on how to achieve 'democratic interoperability'. The purpose of this paper is to identify interoperability enablers that minimally interfere with a country's democratic constitution. Qualitative data has been collected via interviews and documents from a Swedish case study that involves several organizations and systems. The findings include four enablers: open source software, legal interpretations, tailored resource allocation, and a dedicated agency to manage national infrastructure. These enablers managed to balance demands on increased efficiency and effectiveness with respect for privacy and security of the individual and the jurisdiction and autonomy of government agencies. The results contribute to current discussions about governance related to the implementation of technology in the public sector. The paper concludes by suggesting that interoperability in the public sector must be subject to careful multi-disciplinary decision making to ensure balance within the constitutional setting."

Against this backdrop, the purpose of this paper was to develop a method for evaluating e-Participation, which takes into account a nation’s democratic system. Multi-criteria decision analysis was utilized to create a new index by combining datasets of democracy and equality with the UN e-Participation Index 2016. In the new index, authoritarian regimes have lower ranks, and it performed better than UN’s index when testing it towards perceived corruption. The paper concludes by suggesting that the proposed method should be accompanied by indicators of the actual use and impact of e-Participation processes.

Our work has two major goals: first, we seek to discern what are the major subjects addressed by mayors on their personal Facebook accounts (e.g., political marketing, city promotion, national level politics, among others). Second, we investigate the correlates of the activities of mayors on Facebook by zooming in on the individual characteristics of the mayor (gender, age, and education), their leadership style, and social media activity of other relevant actors at the city level (i.e., deputy mayors) as the main determinants. We test the hypotheses derived from this theoretical framework using data from social media activities by the mayors of the largest cities in Poland (above 100.000 residents). Preliminary findings indicate that mayors with an educational background in the social sciences and facing stronger political competition in the last election cycle are more active on Facebook. In addition, younger mayors, mayors belonging to a political party, and mayors who have been recently elected are more likely to successfully engage citizens in interactions in their social media accounts."

Although the overall rate of Malaysia is at a high level, there are 12 states out of a total of 16 states with the rates below the national average. Hence, the high rate nationally may not provide the actual representation of the whole country due to the digital divide phenomenon. Apart from the established fact that broadband has played a significant influence on economic growth, it is also indicated that the broadband is also an enabler of social transformation - one of which is education. Up to 2012 Malaysia spent 5.7 percent of the GDP on education, higher than Thailand, Japan, Indonesia and Singapore. Although a big portion of this expenditure was on ICT, the education performance in Malaysia has not shown much progress. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2009 ranked Malaysian students' minimum proficiency in Reading, Science and Mathematics below the international average. Furthermore, the performance of the two major nationwide examinations namely Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) and Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) have not shown convincing results of the ICT's role on education. Hence, this study examines the relationship between the broadband penetration rate in Malaysia and the education performance at the primary and secondary levels in every state in Malaysia. The outcome of the study indicates that broadband penetration rate has a greater association with the performance of secondary school students in comparison to the primary school."

It soon became clear, however, that not all users were not getting the type of information or instruction that they needed from this arrangement, and that there was a need for an intermediary in this continuum of services. Increasingly, libraries fulfill this role. Instead of direct government-to-user interaction, information channels flow from agency to librarian to user, from user back up to agency, and from agency to user to librarian. This paper expands on the idea of these multiple pathways of information through research conducted in collaboration with libraries, government agencies, state library agencies, and a national library association in the United States with aims to create an e-government web resource to assist librarians engaging in e-government services. The different pathways of information both informed the creation of the web resource and offered a practical model of e-government, important for other projects dealing with similar information."

The above activities are usually the responsibility of Government Departments handing survey, revenue collection and land / property registrations. Other Government Departments also take up soil health mapping, mapping of roads, railways, utilities etc, to facilitate decision making. With the advent of modern technology enablers like cloud, service oriented architecture etc, systems have become interoperable and the concept of the Government Enterprise is gaining momentum. Wherein, all the Departments in the government can seamlessly share and benefit from cross the Government Enterprise for effective administration and management. Thus, the Government Department maps can be overlaid on cadastral maps, which is the base layer provided they have followed the global geodetic coordinate standards, and this extended multipurpose cadastre can enable advanced geospatial based decision making for effective administration as well as management. The multipurpose cadastral system will enable a systematic and holistic development of comprehensive management of land related datasets and ensures integrated land records services to the policy makers, citizens and land planners in the country.

The research will adopt a qualitative case study and design science. This will be complemented with behavioural research approach. To achieve the main objectives, there are a number of activities planned for this research. These activities are: investigation of maturity level for e-government systems; assessing information security maturity level; evaluation of authentication systems in use; design the interoperable identity authentication framework; and evaluation of the proposed framework. The framework will go through a number iterations in design and evaluations."

This study proposed the construction of an index, we call Smart City Index for Analytics (SM-CIA), to objectively measure the degree of smartness in urban cities in six domain areas. We then conducted a pilot testing of SM-CIA on major cities in China. Publicly available data were collected from 2008 to 2012 and time trend analysis was conducted to detect changes of the cities in various smart city domains. A significant increasing trend was found in smart living, mobility, economy and governance domains. Cross-sectional analysis was conducted to rank the cities. The top three cities were Xiamen, Shenzhen and Shanghai. To validate the proposed index, the findings were compared with the Lien Public Service Excellence Index, one of the recent indices developed for China's cities. The results suggested that the cities' scores based on our proposed SM-CIA were correlated with the business perspective of Lien's Index, but not with the citizen's perspective. This is on-going work towards the construction of a global smart city index."

However, research so far widely neglects the interplay of e-government service adoption preferences and government's delivery. Moreover, research on e-service delivery channels has just started. To address these gaps, we investigated two research questions using Germany as an example. (1) To what extent does the current level of e-services delivered match citizens' preferences? (2) To what extent do current e-service delivery channels match citizens' preferences? Following an exploratory research approach, we surveyed 956 citizens in six German cities. Furthermore we reviewed these cities' e-service deliveries. Our findings indicate no significant correlation between e-service adoption and delivery. Rather, we observed a large gap between citizens' level of digital preferences and cities' level of digitalization. In respect to delivery channels, cities' supply matches citizens' preferences for classic online channels but not for multi-channel."

However, existing empirical evidence suggests the results of collaborative innovations in public administration tend to be mostly unimpressive and hardly transformational. This doctoral research project asks why this is the case and what factors shape the success and failure of ICT-driven co-creation. These questions are addressed by a qualitative investigation of the various drivers and barriers that affect the development, implementation, diffusion and outcomes of ICT-enabled co-creation initiatives. The thesis also explores the strategies that public sector organizations could employ to avoid failure and feed success."

This paper presents the results of the comparison of techniques currently used to assess different aspects of e-participation performance and impacts. The paper also proposes a new method of assessment and suggests a way to select the proper e-participation assessment methodology. The authors applied T. Paronson's AGIL paradigm to identifying the social functions and values that are prerequisites for any society to be able to persist and evolve over time. The research results show that the majority of approaches were focused on technology and policy frameworks existence and use, as well as on different interpretations of social impacts. This study revealed the lack of economic impacts interpretation and measurement tools for decision-making evaluation.

In this paper, we present a model to analyse government initiatives to publish budget data. We identify the main features of these initiatives with a double objective: (i) to drive a structured analysis, relating some dimensions to their possible impacts, and (ii) to derive characterization attributes to compare initiatives based on each dimension. We define use perspectives and analyse some initiatives using this model. We conclude that, in order to favour use perspectives, special attention must be given to user feedback, semantics standards and linking possibilities."

It is apparent that little attention is given in recent research focusing on the use of network analysis as a way to explore coordination preparedness for this type of organisation. In this study, we emphasise this type of soft-target organisation and propose a model to examine the coordination preparedness to any disasters by testing hypothesis related to network relationship and coordination preparedness. We analyse the dataset entitled Preparedness of Large Retail Malls to Prevent and Respond to Terrorist Attack, 2004, which contains a total of 120 completed surveys of security directors of retail malls. The following questions form the basis of this study: What do soft-target organisations need to be better prepared to respond to disaster? How does network relationship between soft-target organisation and emergency agencies affect the coordination preparedness of soft-target organisation for disaster recovery? Which degree of centrality measure needs to be followed to measure network variables in order to analyse the coordination preparedness? Result shows that soft-target organisation with high level of network relationship with other emergency agencies are better prepared to disaster response. Using this result, the preparedness of a soft-target organisation might be judged for successfully participation in an actual emergency."

A lack of insight exists in understanding and managing the life-cycle of these initiatives on public administration information systems for data modelling and data exchange. In this paper, we outline state-of-the-art implementations and vocabularies linked to the core data models. In particular we inventoried and selected existing core data models and identified tendencies in current practices based on the criteria creation, use, maintenance and coordination. Based on the analysis, this survey suggest research directions for policy and information management studies pointing to best practices regarding core data model implementations and their role in linking isolated data silos within a cross-country context.

Yet, businesses are often reluctant to share, as data sharing might not just provide benefits but also entails risks. Therefore, a system supporting B2G information sharing should provide the appropriate level of openness, such that the advantages of openness and possibilities to control risks for businesses are balanced. At the same time, the information obtained by the government should be useful. We identified three architectural layers at which B2G information sharing architectures can have different levels of openness, viz. the Software Layer, the Access Control Layer and the Data Layer. In this work, we compare three archetypical configurations of architectures for B2G information sharing with different levels of openness. Our aim is to provide insight into their impact on the possibilities for obtaining advantages from information sharing and managing risks of opening up data. We found that the relationship between the different levels of openness and the advantages and risks of information sharing is highly complex.

This paper explores whether undertaking this transformation has a positive effect on the quality of online service delivery, using data gathered from seventy local governments. We found that having an externally oriented management strategy in place, adopting enterprise architecture, aligning information systems to business and sharing activities between processes and departments are positively related to the quality of online service delivery. We recommend that further research should be carried out to find out whether dimensions of organizational development too have an effect on online service delivery in the long term."

In this paper, we present user requirements engineering activities for e-Government services, demonstrate their effectiveness by means of a case study, and reflect upon their use. We used a combination of interviews with clients and involved service employees, which resulted in a set of requirements covering the different needs of future users. The design based on these requirements was tested with fifteen potential end-users, using rapid prototyping and a citizen walkthrough. These sessions show that it is crucial to test user requirements with potential end-users to create an e-Service that successfully caters to clients, providing such things as personalization and interoperability in an e-Government setting."

The development of information technology (IT) projects in Thai public agencies was initiated in the early 1990s, albeit without developing a national IT master plan or establishing a national IT agency. However, when many problems arose in the use of IT in public agencies, the Thai government formulated in 1996 the first national IT master plan to cope with e-governance problems. This case study illustrates the Thai e-governments development experiences and examines e-government strategic approaches. The lessons may be relevant to and may be a learning experience for countries at similar stages of development."

Can we make more inclusive the deliberative model itself? If we arrive at building such a model, this would be an important step towards a better democratic governance. I propose a model, which I call ""Direct Deliberative Democracy"" (abbr. ""D3""), and which is expected to bring a positive answer to the above question. D3 is based on three main concepts: (A) Mass Online Deliberation (MOD) with its procedural framework, already presented in a number of my conference papers and in two co-authored book chapters; (B) ""argumentative facilitation"", which consists in assisting the least prepared citizens in formulating better arguments within a deliberation on an issue of their concern; and (C) ""implicit voting"", which consists in algorithmically aggregating the non-participants' values, interests and preferences into the decision-making process, in a way deemed epistemically better than the classical ""explicit"" voting. To put these basic concepts into practice, we need a set of procedures governing participants' actions and interactions, and an interactive IT system to implement and enforce those procedures. For MOD (Part A above), both the concept and the procedural framework are already well elaborated. The concept of argumentative facilitation (Part B) has been presented in one of my 2017 papers, and the work on the appropriate procedural framework is under way. The concept of implicit voting (Part C) is introduced in this paper for the first time; I am not expecting its large immediate acceptance, because it puts into question the understanding of universal suffrage in today's democracies as an explicit and discretionary expression of everyone's will."

This data can be used to build and measure indicators to study and analyze different urban phenomena. Information obtained through such indicators enables to understand city patterns, develop public policies and implement corrective actions. This on-going research work explores the use of dashboards - information visualization tools, as a powerful mechanism to enhance decision-making processes in government. At this preliminary stage, we introduce the motivations to use dashboards in the public sector and the main issues concerning their adoption by municipal governments. We analyze how dashboards can be applied to obtain accurate and representative information about urban problems with the aim of supporting decision-making processes to improve cities performance. We discuss related initiatives and describe our case study in the city of Bahía Blanca.

In order to reduce repetitive and redundant supervisory controls and promote automatic administration procedures, electronic data interchange (EDI)1 and other forms of information sharing are introduced and implemented. Compliance monitoring ensures data quality for information exchange and audit purpose. However, failure to be compliant with various regulations is still a general phenomenon globally among stakeholders in supply chains, leading to more problems such as delay of goods delivery, missing inventory, and security issues. To address these problems, traditional physical auditing methods are widely used but turned out to be time-consuming and costly, especially when multiple stakeholders are involved. Since there is limited empirical research on compliance monitoring for regulatory supervision in international supply chains, we propose a compliance monitoring framework that can be applied with data sharing and analytics. The framework implementation is validated by an extensive case study on customs supervision in the Netherlands using process mining techniques. Practically, both public and private sectors will benefit from our descriptive and prescriptive analytics for audit purposes. Theoretically, our control strategies developed at the operational level facilitates mitigation of risks at root causes."

The discussion is framed through a tentative model on how to integrate legitimacy in design and development of e-government. In theory legitimacy is built on legality and trust towards and within the state. In practice it is developed through a socio-technical collaborative formation of local cultures based on common values, trust, interpretation of systems and practices. Legitimacy is crucial for democratic governance and is a basic prerequisite for all governments. Legitimacy is most often seen as generated through personal, face-to-face meetings, but e-government substitutes such opportunities for interaction. Egovernments is neither clearly place-bound. Legitimacy thus has to be gained and sustained in slightly different ways. This paper brings a political science perspective on legitimacy into the IS discussion on e-government. Legitimacy of e-government has to be further theoretically extended to be useful and applicable for sustainable e-societies in different governmental context. Here a conceptual model on legitimacy of egovernment is elaborated on in relation to local socio-technical settings and co-produced processes."

The framework builds on current technologies for multi-threaded discussion, natural language processing, ontologies, and formal argumentation frameworks. This paper focuses on the natural language processing of statements in the framework. A small sample policy discussion is presented. We adopt and apply a controlled natural language (Attempto Controlled English) to constrain the domain of discourse, eliminate ambiguity and unclarity, allow a logical representation of statements which supports inference and consistency checking, and facilitate information extraction. Each of the policy statements is automatically translated into first-order logic. The result is a logical representation of the policy discussion which we can query, draw inferences (given ground statements), test for consistency, and extract detailed information."

The technologies used in the delivery of electronic voting, the locations related to the different stages of the process and the main legal issues involved have been identified in the existing literature. These five elements, namely agents, legal issues, process stages, technologies used and locations involved, form the framework of this taxonomy. The aim of the taxonomy is to provide an insight into the legal issues emerging according to the different combined relationships between these five elements, and provide a tool for the identification of legal accountabilities amongst the different agents involved."

In this paper we present a framework for the evaluation of the level of difficulty involved in the deployment of e-voting schemes. Taking the public authoritys point of view we identify eight factors, which increase the overall difficulty of e-voting administration. We suggest that as new e-voting technologies and associated activities are introduced in the re-design of the electoral process, its administration becomes increasingly more difficult. We provide examples explaining the practical use of the suggested framework based on some of the 2003 UK e-voting pilots. In concluding we refer to existing limitations of the framework and suggest future work, which could expand its analytical value."

However while studies have utilized factors such as sentiment and frequency of tweets to evaluate candidate favorability, little research has been conducted in analyzing Twitter location data. This paper makes two major contributions. First, it studies the subjectivity and polarity of Twitter data based on the location of the tweets. Findings from this research will enable further fine grained analysis of Twitter data by using the location variable, allowing for more accurate results of user sentiment and behavior analysis. Second, we present a web-based system which can enable in the collection of Twitter data, extraction of the location, perform data analysis and then to plot them on a maps for visualization.

As the importance of data has increased, interest in the availability of public sector information (PSI) has also grown. PSI created in the public sector comprises public attributes and directly impacts national administration and citizen's lives. Korea has almost the highest level of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and considerable data through government-led policies. As a result of such policies, Korea has demonstrated excellent results in the United Nation's e-government survey, ITU's ICT development index, and OECD's public data openness index. Paradoxically, however, this history and experience is a stumbling block to a new era. PSI, which is a basic resource for realizing the value of openness, sharing, cooperation, and communication, should be actively managed and opened by government to provide support for reuse in the sense that the government is its main producer and manager. However, no matter how good the quality of PSI through data management is and how excellent policies and institutions are established, if the private sector cannot actively use it, it is useless. What is the role of government and law in the context of changing the way data is managed and blurring sectoral boundaries? This paper aims to propose core challenges by analyzing the case of Korea in order to derive a basis for discussions to coordinate public and private cooperation and legal relations in the process. To begin with, we analyze the changes in the management environment of data and PSI and identify the role of government and law in responding to changes in the legal rights. Then, we discuss how Korea responds to change, examines related policies by function and discussions on the data law, which seem to have the greatest effect on government's role, and suggests essential tasks to change its role accordingly."

However, the existing student-centred learning strategies such as Problem Based Learning (PBL) and the utilization of new technologies (e.g. Learning Analytics, Linked Open Data, Semantics etc) often do not show the expected benefits. In the context of this thesis, these issues will be studied and addressed. More specifically, PBL will be extended so as to allow such skills development, inventive tools and methods usage and connection with the web of data.

This study aims to examine to which extent and by which factors the acceptance and use of open data infrastructures by researchers can be influenced. For this purpose we use an integrated model of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the two-stage Expectation Confirmation Theory of Information Systems continuance (ECT). Our research confirms the hypothesis that Perceived Usefulness (PU), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI) and Trust (T) in the pre-usage stage can be used to predict PU, EE, SI and T in the post-usage stage, which may subsequently influence the acceptance and use of open data infrastructures. Nevertheless, not all of our findings show support for applying the combined UTAUT-ECT model, and the findings suggest that the model needs to be specified and adapted for the domain of open data.

Yet, companies appear to challenge the assumption that open data can be used to create competitive advantage, since any company can access open data and since open data use requires scarce resources. In this paper we examine commercial open data use for creating competitive advantage from the perspective of Resource Based Theory (RBT) and Resource Dependency Theory (RDT). Based on insights from a scenario, interviews and a survey and from RBT and RDT as a reference theory, we derive seven propositions. Our study suggests that the generation of competitive advantage with open data requires a company to have in-house capabilities and resources for open data use. The actual creation of competitive advantage might not be simple. The propositions also draw attention to the accomplishment of unique benefits for a company through the combination of internal and external resources. Recommendations for further research include testing the propositions."

Giving the increasing number of cloud applications, also in the field of e-Government, identity management is also vital in the area of cloud computing. Several cloud identity models have already emerged, whereas the so-called “Identity as a Service”-model seems to be the most promising one. Cloud service providers currently implement this model by relying on a central identity broker, acting as a hub between different service and identity providers. While the identity broker model has a couple of advantages, still some disadvantages can be identified. One major drawback of the central identity broker model is that both the user and the service provider must rely on one and the same identity broker for identification and authentication. This heavily decreases flexibility and hinders freedom of choice for selecting other identity broker implementations. We bypass this issue by proposing a federated identity as a service model, where identity brokers are interconnected. This federated identity as a service model retains the benefits but eliminates the drawbacks of the central cloud identity broker model."
