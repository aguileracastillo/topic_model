Indeed many governments see their responsibility in ensuring the inclusion of the regions they represent in a ‘Networked Society’, and in doing so, ensuring some control over the transformation process. In this process the ‘Networked Society’ becomes a prescriptive concept that designates a desirable objective: A space for ‘making’ Europe by connecting multiple actors. This paper considers critically the limits of the Network Society-concept for researching the very phenomena it sets out to describe. The paper is based on a 3-year ethnographic study of a European Commission initiative to create a European community of practitioners working in the field of eGovernment. The paper attends to material-discursive practices associated with sharing approaches that support and disrupt the making of an ‘interconnected Europe’ and a ‘European Information Society’. The paper provides evidence that such practices do not link and reconfigure independently existing entities, but rather that subject and objects come to be produced within and through such association.","2015","2022-04-24 14:40:04","2022-04-24 14:40:04","2022-04-24 14:40:01","","","","","","","""Networking"" a European Community","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","","","","Europe; eGovernment; social network; sociomateriality; intra-action; networked society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electronic Government, or E-Government, is widely regarded as a disruptor of traditional e-government service provision through greater citizen access, enhanced democracy, improved information quality, and a range of governmental efficiencies. Local government has been a key e-government focus for many nations due to the wide and varied interactions these governmental agencies have with citizens. A gap in the literature exists that monitors the development of local e-government, especially from the policy maker perspective, of This study presents the findings of a longitudinal study exploring the development of local e-government in New Zealand – from the policy makers’ perspective. All local and regional authorities in New Zealand were surveyed in 2000, 2004, and 2012 with the goal of understanding the key considerations associated with the development of e-government strategies and subsequent implementation of associated infrastructure. While local e-government development has been more incremental than transformational, there has been a trend towards greater consideration of citizen-focused issues including the likes of Consumer Confidence, Trust, Accessibility, The Digital Divide, Indigenous Peoples, Security, and Privacy. This offers a degree of reassurance that local authorities remain, and are indeed increasingly, focused on the provision of enhanced services to the communities they serve.","2015","2022-04-24 14:34:04","2022-04-24 14:34:04","2022-04-24 14:34:00","","","","","","","A Longitudinal Study of Local E-Government Development","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","","","","E-Government; Local Government; Governmental Issues","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Private individuals increasingly become both providers and consumers of services. Web 2.0 enables peer-to-peer transactions between consumers creating a new consumption space with hundreds of mediator platforms. While the new legally questionable market is typically seen as a challenge by governments, the opportunities for governments to participate in peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and collaborative consumption services (SCCS) for their citizens are hardly explored in academia. In contrast, first pioneer governments such as the cities of Seoul and San Francisco have already developed strategies to support the development of P2P SCCS for their citizens. In this work, we advocate for extending the function scope of e-government by including P2P SCCS into its portfolio. To support our reasoning and in order to systematically address the problem area emerging from the combination of e-government and P2P SCCS, we review and synthesize e-government models and relate them to the P2P SCCS phenomenon. Our results reveal what constitutes a research agenda for utilizing potentials of P2P SCCS in the context of e-government research and practice.","2015","2022-04-24 14:31:37","2022-04-24 14:31:37","2022-04-24 14:31:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","","","","E-Government; Collaborative Consumption; Peer-to-Peer Sharing; Sharing Services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, being aware of the challenges of e-government implementation is not sufficient, as challenges may interrelate and impact each other. Therefore, a systematic analysis of the challenges and their interrelationships contributes to providing a better understanding of how to tackle the challenges and how to develop sustainable solutions. This paper aims to investigate existing challenges of e-government and their interdependencies in Tanzania. The collection of e-government challenges in Tanzania is implemented through interviews, desk research and observations of actors in their job. In total, 32 challenges are identified. The subsequent PESTEL analysis studied interrelationships of challenges and identified 34 interrelationships. The analysis of the interrelationships informs policy decision makers of issues to focus on along the planning of successfully implementing the existing e-government strategy in Tanzania. The study also identified future research needs in evaluating the findings through quantitative analysis.","2015","2022-04-24 14:46:04","2022-04-24 14:46:04","2022-04-24 14:46:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","","","","E-government; challenges; strategic planning; PESTEL; interdependencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using qualitative (interviews and documents) and quantitative (Facebook posts) data, the study identifies several uses of social media in emergency preparedness and emergency management, as well as the organizational context that affects this use. Findings indicate that social media support various purposes of use, including information dissemination, obtaining input from the public and other organizations, and participation by other emergency response organizations. Branding of the organization during the emergency preparedness phase was found to be an important aspect of information dissemination, and helps social media to be useful tool to connect with the public and other organizations during the emergency response phase. Nevertheless, social media use in the emergency response domain still has to overcome leadership and staff adoption barriers.","2015","2022-04-24 14:54:03","2022-04-24 14:54:03","2022-04-24 14:54:01","","","","","","","Just Keep Tweeting","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","","","","Social Media; Emergency Response; IT adoption; Organizational IT use","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
